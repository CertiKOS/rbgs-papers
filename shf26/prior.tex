\emph{FMitF:Track I:ADVERT:Compositional Atomic Specifications for
Distributed System Verification}, with Co-PIs Robert Soule (Yale) and
Ji-Yong Shin (Northeastern).  \textbf{Intellectual Merit:} Developed
novel compositional atomic distributed object
models~\cite{ado,adore,adob,lido,lido-dag} that reduce the complexity
of verifying distributed systems. Explored different consensus
protocols~\cite{lido,lido-dag,mysticeti-proof} to create network-based
specifications that connect individual implementation to each
high-level model through refinement.  \textbf{Broader Impacts:} Found
and fixed a subtle liveness bug in the Sui Lab's currently deployed Mysticeti
protocol~\cite{mysticeti} by presenting the first complete analysis of
its safety and liveness; integrated the ADO technology into
undergraduate and graduate courses on "Language-Based Security" and
"Distributed Systems" at Yale and Northeastern.  {\bf Evidence of
  Research Products} include four
PLDI~\cite{adore,lido,lido-dag,compcerto}, five
POPL~\cite{layered22,wang2022,ctlinear23,compcerto2,compcertoe}, one
S\&P~\cite{mysticeti-proof}, one CCS~\cite{ou23}, and four OOPSLA
papers~\cite{ado,adob,liu2022a,crashlin24}, most accompanied with
peer-reviewedd full ``functional'' artifacts.
