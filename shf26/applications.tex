\subsection{Unix Processes}

Main issue is concurrency.
Can 'seq' be adapted to start both processes?
(challenge is dynamic thread id allocation)

\subsection{One-time Pad}

can you have a simple languages with security labels,
deterministic and no declassification,
combine with one-time pad \emph{probabilistic} property
to show that a secure program that uses it remains
probabilistically secure

\subsection{Proposed Work}

\paragraph{Task 3a: One-time pad basics (manual spec)}

\paragraph{Task 3b: One-time pad used by deterministically secure program}

\paragraph{Task 3c: Example~\ref{ex:readwritehello} with Concurrency}

\paragraph{Task 3d: Richer Unix Model}
