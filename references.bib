  abstract="We show how to introduce demonic and angelic nondeterminacy
    into the term language of each type in typical programming or
    specification language. For each type we introduce (binary infix)
    operators ⊓ and ⊔ on terms of the type, corresponding to demonic and
    angelic nondeterminacy, respectively. We generalise these operators to
    accommodate unbounded nondeterminacy. We axiomatise the operators and
    derive their important properties. We show that a suitable model for
    nondeterminacy is the free completely distributive complete lattice over
    a poset, and we use this to show that our axiomatisation is sound. In
    the process, we exhibit a strong relationship between nondeterminacy and
    free lattices that has not hitherto been evident. Although
    nondeterminacy arises naturally in specification and programming
    languages, we speculate that it combines fruitfully with function theory
    to the extent that it can play an important role in facilitating proofs
    of programs that have no apparent connection with nondeterminacy.",

  abstract="We present a new lattice-theoretic model for communicating
    sequential processes. The model underpins a process algebra that is very
    close to CSP. It differs from CSP ``at the edges'' for the purposes of
    creating an elegant algebra of communicating processes. The one
    significant difference is that we postulate additional distributive
    properties for external choice. The shape of the algebra that emerges
    suggests a lattice-theoretic model, in contrast to traditional
    trace-theoretic models. We show how to build the new model in a
    mathematically clean step-by-step process. The essence of our approach
    is to model simple processes (i.e. those without choice, parallelism, or
    recursion) as a poset S of sequences, and then order-embed S into a
    complete (and completely distributive) lattice called the free
    completely distributive lattice over S. We explain the technique in
    detail and show that the resulting model does indeed capture our algebra
    of communicating sequential processes. The focus of the paper is not on
    the algebra per se, but on the model and the soundness of the algebra.",
