  abstract="In this short essay, we describe in informal terms how game
  semantics can be seen to arise as a perturbation of process calculi such
  as CSP, by making an explicit distinction between the r{\^o}les of the
  System and the Environment. Drawing out the consequences of this
  distinction uncovers a wealth of mathematical structure, with Game
  intuitions entering in a natural and compelling fashion. This leads
  ultimately to the elaboration of mathematically well-structured and
  behaviourally expressive semantic universes for computation. These
  provide a basis for fully abstract models of a wide range of programming
  languages, and lead on to algorithmic methods, with applications to
  compositional model-checking and program analysis.",

  abstract="Alternating transition systems are a general model for
  composite systems which allow the study of collaborative as well as
  adversarial relationships between individual system components. Unlike
  in labeled transition systems, where each transition corresponds to a
  possible step of the system (which may involve some or all
  components), in alternating transition systems, each transition
  corresponds to a possible move in a game between the components. In
  this paper, we study refinement relations between alternating
  transition systems, such as ``Does the implementation refine the set A
  of specification components without constraining the components not in
  A?'' In particular, we generalize the definitions of the simulation
  and trace containment preorders from labeled transition systems to
  alternating transition systems. The generalizations are called
  alternating simulation and alternating trace containment. Unlike
  existing refinement relations, they allow the refinement of individual
  components within the context of a composite system description. We
  show that, like ordinary simulation, alternating simulation can be
  checked in polynomial time using a fixpoint computation algorithm.
  While ordinary trace containment is PSPACE-complete, we establish
  alternating trace containment to be EXPTIME-complete. Finally, we
  present logical characterizations for the two preorders in terms of
  ATL, a temporal logic capable of referring to games between system
  components.",

    operators ⊓ and ⊔ on terms of the type, corresponding to demonic and
    angelic nondeterminacy, respectively. We generalise these operators to
    accommodate unbounded nondeterminacy. We axiomatise the operators and
    derive their important properties. We show that a suitable model for
    nondeterminacy is the free completely distributive complete lattice over
    a poset, and we use this to show that our axiomatisation is sound. In
    the process, we exhibit a strong relationship between nondeterminacy and
    free lattices that has not hitherto been evident. Although
    nondeterminacy arises naturally in specification and programming
    languages, we speculate that it combines fruitfully with function theory
    to the extent that it can play an important role in facilitating proofs
    of programs that have no apparent connection with nondeterminacy.",

  abstract="We present a new lattice-theoretic model for communicating
    sequential processes. The model underpins a process algebra that is very
    close to CSP. It differs from CSP ``at the edges'' for the purposes of
    creating an elegant algebra of communicating processes. The one
    significant difference is that we postulate additional distributive
    properties for external choice. The shape of the algebra that emerges
    suggests a lattice-theoretic model, in contrast to traditional
    trace-theoretic models. We show how to build the new model in a
    mathematically clean step-by-step process. The essence of our approach
    is to model simple processes (i.e. those without choice, parallelism, or
    recursion) as a poset S of sequences, and then order-embed S into a
    complete (and completely distributive) lattice called the free
    completely distributive lattice over S. We explain the technique in
    detail and show that the resulting model does indeed capture our algebra
    of communicating sequential processes. The focus of the paper is not on
    the algebra per se, but on the model and the soundness of the algebra.",
