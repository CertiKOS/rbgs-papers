Panel Summary

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED RESEARCH ACTIVITY

This proposal aims at integrating several proven techniques into a
certified compiler toolchain to improve its modularity, expressivity,
and security.  This proposal has the potential of solving a vast array
of problems and provides many high-level intuitions on how to proceed.
The ambitious goal of making certified compilation practical raises
many significant engineering problems that this proposal wants to
address using results from e.g. the nominal memory model.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT

The panel appreciated the diversity of the tools summoned to address
many challenging problems at the same time, within a single unified
toolchain, and thought that the PIs are well qualified to make
important contributions to this problem.  The benchmarking aspect of
the proposal was also one of its strengths, and the panel has no
doubts that the fine details of integrating those ideas into a
verified compiler will be challenging.  However, the panel would have
appreciated reading more details about the adventurous scientific
components: for instance, is there any advances in game semantics to
be expected from this endeavor?  The proposal could have better
fleshed out the scientific challenges in extending formal verification
to ELF (Executable and Linkable Format). Moreover, the security aspect
of the proposal is exciting but the panel felt that it was discussed
too briefly.

BROADER IMPACTS

The panel appreciated the potential for a strong technological
transfer.  The connection with CertiKOS could have been fleshed out in
more detail, but the panel agrees that this transfer could have a
significant impact.

SOLICITATION-SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA

The collaboration plan and BPC plan are both very good, even if the
panel believes that the collaboration plan could have shared
additional details about the practical organization of the tasks.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

The panel suggests to focus the proposal on the scientific outcomes
likely to result from the proposed work.  The connection to existing
work on formal semantics for ELF files (see citations in individual
review) could have been made explicit.  The proposal could flesh out
in more detail the many interesting ideas it contains.

SUMMARY STATEMENT

This proposal aims at combining many existing ideas to improve the
state-of-the-art in verified compilation, and contains many useful
ideas.  The scientific contribution is unfortunately not clear, as
many of the work tasks presented in the proposal feels more like
engineering issues that are unlikely to produce unexpected outcomes.

The recommendation of the panel is that the proposal is Competitive.

Proposal Review 1 : 2312365

Multiple Rating: (Very Good/Good)

Summary

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to intellectual
merit.

This proposal seeks to extend work on verified compilation in five
directions, using CompCert as a starting point:

1. New techniques for compositional verified compilation, building on
prior work related to language interfaces in the style of game
semantics;

2. Extensions of the CompCert memory model -- which is block/offset
based and which therefore makes certain reasoning patterns on memory
noncompositional -- to a proposed nominal memory model;

3. Lowering of the verified compiler to ELF object files;

4. Techniques for security-preserving compilation;

5. Applications to OS kernel verification.

STRENGTHS:

+ CompCertO's game semantics-inspired language interfaces nicely
generalize earlier operational models used in compositional
compilers. The proposed tasks in Section 2 are interesting extensions
of that work.

+ The work on nominal extensions of CompCert's memory model is well motivated.

+ The PIs have extensive experience on CompCert-related projects,
starting from CompCertX.

+ The evaluation plan is ambitious but solid: the PIs have worked on a
number of "benchmark" projects, including CertiKOS, upon which to test
the techniques.

+ The PIs have adequate resources at Yale to complete the work.

WEAKNESSES:

- [CompCertO; State Encapsulation] The motivation of Task 1b in
  Section 2.3 is unclear to me. It's true that C has no language-level
  notion of "object" like C++. It's also true that some applications
  to be compiled by CompCertO might roll their own objects, e.g., as
  structs with function pointers. But why should it matter to the
  compiler proof whether an application happens to be written this
  way?

- [2b Nominal memory; Separation algebras] While I agree that
  separation algebras are useful, they've mostly found application in
  the semantic models of separation logics. There's not enough detail
  in 2b to understand except at a very high level how they will be
  used to lift CompCert's `nextblock` constraint, etc.

- [3c Compositional ELF linker/loader] This section doesn't adequately
  explain how the CompCertO model together with nominal memory will
  facilitate the correctness proof of an ELF linker. Why does
  CompCertO/nominal memory in particular make ELF linker verification
  easier?

- [3 ELF linker] The proposal didn't clearly spell out how the ELF
  linker verification work relates to earlier work in this space,
  e.g., [The Missing Link, Kell, Mulligan & Sewell, OOPSLA'16,
  https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/papers/oopsla-elf-linking-2016.pdf].

- [5 Secure Compilation] This is a big topic (it even has its own
  workshop co-located with POPL!
  https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/prisc-2023). The proposed work on
  secure compilation makes technical sense at a high level but doesn't
  clearly frame the work in the context of existing
  research. Cf. recent years' PRiSC proceedings.

- [Task 5d: "We will apply our new security-preserving compiler to
  Concurrent CertiKOS and SeKVM and build end-to-end security proofs
  to the binary machine code level."] Concurrency makes this extremely
  ambitious, and it's unclear from the short description which sorts
  of security properties the PIs have in mind. Does the proposed work
  plan to deal with information flows that result from concurrent
  interactions of threads?


In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to broader
impacts.

STRENGTHS:

+ PI Shao has a track record of transferring verification technologies to industry (CertiK).

WEAKNESSES:

- The BI plan describes previous tech transfer work but doesn't plan
  in detail the newly proposed work.

- The curriculum development plan is reasonable, but could be
  strengthened by describing more thoroughly how tools like Nominal
  CompCertO will be incorporated the new Formal Semantics and revamped
  Language-Based Security courses. How students would use and learn
  from them? What sorts of programming labs do the PIs have in mind?
  Do the PIs imagine that students will just use the tools to verify
  new systems, or extend them? Etc.

Please evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with
respect to any additional solicitation-specific review criteria, if
applicable

> 1. Goal and Context: Does the plan describe a goal and the data from
  your institution(s) or local community that justifies that goal?

Yes, in the departmental plan.

> 2. Intended population(s): Does the plan identify the
  characteristics of participants from an underrepresented group,
  including school level (e.g., African American undergraduates or
  female high-school students)?

Yes, in the departmental plan.

> 3. Strategy: Does the plan describe activities that address the
  stated goal(s) and intended population(s)?

Yes, in the departmental plan.

> 4. Measurement: Is there a plan to measure the outcome(s) of the
  activities?

Yes, in the departmental plan.

> 5. PI Engagement: Is there a clear role for each PI and co-PI? Does
  the plan describe how the PI is prepared (or will prepare or
  collaborate) to do the proposed work?​​

Yes. PI Shao has identified roles in the BPC paragraph in the project
description and in the department plan. PI Koenig has identified roles
in the BPC paragraph.

Summary Statement

This is a reasonably good proposal. It rests on a solid foundation of
related work (CompCertO and its predecessors); the PIs have experience
in the area and a long working relationship; the proposed work is
interesting and seems technically sound; and the broader impacts plan
is reasonable, if not overly detailed.

It's also quite ambitious, perhaps covering too much ground. I wonder
whether the proposal could be improved if it focused on just three or
so of the five research areas. This would give space to flesh out the
plans in those areas, and spend more time putting the proposed work in
the context of related work. In particular, the section on secure
compilation seemed promising but underdeveloped. Perhaps it could be
made a more central part of the proposal (in place of one or two of
the other thrusts). Or it could be removed to give more space the
other proposed lines of work.

Review
Summary

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to intellectual
merit.

(1) The proposal will develop some extensions of the CompCert verified
compiler. The main goal is to investigate specifications of open-world
programs that can interact with their environments, as in the
preliminary work on CompCertO based on game semantics, and to provide
support for encapsulated state. The techniques will be applied to
develop certified concurrent OS kernels and hypervisors. The strength
of the propoal is that it will synthesize a number of ideas (game
semantics, nominal logic, information flow) into a significant verified
compiler implementation.

(2) From the proposal, the project seems to be more about applying
existing ideas in a new setting than developing any completely new
techniques. But there seems to be a lot of interesting work in the fine
details of integrating the ideas into a verified compiler.

(3) The plan is good -- the proposal describes a number of concrete
research tasks that seem achievable and well thought-out. The proposal
has very clearly stated deliverables as a mechanism of evaluation.

(4) The PI and co-PI have strong expertise in the topics, and the
project builds off of significant software infrastructure that they have
developed in past work. The project will fund graduate students, which
seems essential given the engineering-heavy nature of the project.

(5) The resources are good --- no special equipment is required for the
project.


In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to broader
impacts.


(1) There seems to be a high likelihood of technology transfer, given
the PI's startup CertiK applying these techniques in industry.

The ideas developed in the project will be integrated into two courses
on Formal Semantics and Language-Based Security.

Review
Summary

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to intellectual
merit.

CompCert verified C compiler is a landmark result that demonstrated
the scalability and maturity of program verification
technologies. While CompCert is a full-fledged C compiler (it
generates low-level "executable" code), it doesn't implement many
features that we have come to expect of a modern compiler. Separate
compilation and the ability to generate linux (ELF) binaries are the
two biggest missing pieces. There are also several design choices made
by CompCert in the interest of simplicity (of verification) that
unfortunately make it hard to extend it to concurrent and insecure
programming environments. The proposal seeks to address these
drawbacks. Separate compilation, in particular, requires non-trivial
scientific innovation as CompCert is a whole-program verifying
compiler by design. Supporting separate compilation requires
fundamental re-think of several specification and verification
approaches adopted inside CompCert. PIs have partially addressed this
challenge in their recent work (CompCertO) using novel Game
Semantics. The PIs now propose to build on their prior work by
(a). Reconciling CompCert's trace semantics with CompCertO's game
semantics, (b). Developing a nominal memory model to replace
CompCert's block-based memory model so as to enable flexible
implementations and support concurrency, (c). Extending verification
pipeline generate ELF files which will then make use of certified ELF
linker and loader, and (d). Extending verification to information flow
security building on PIs' prior work on security-preserving
simulations.

**Strengths** The project marshals several innovations from the PIs'
  research towards the ambitious goal of making certified compilation
  practical. If successful, it has the potential to significantly
  advance the state-of-the-art in verified compilation, while also
  making it practical to deploy end-to-end verified executables in
  several application domains. Ther new interface to memory might also
  make it easy to implement verified compilation for relaxed memory
  models (CompCertTSO authors remark that their semantic design
  "involves a surprisingly delicate interplay between the relaxed
  memory mode and the behavior of block allocation and free"). The
  proposed development of security-preserving simulation could find
  uses elsewhere, e.g., verification of privacy-preserving
  communication protocols.

**Weaknesses** Game semantics has been introduced in PIs recent work
  (CompCertO, PLDI'21), which seems to have addressed the separate
  compilation problem of CompCert to a great extent. The new work
  proposed on this front seems incremental and without a definite
  purpose. For e.g., it is not clear what would result from
  establishing an analogue to trace containment and inclusion; re-use
  of CompCert proofs? I am however satisfied with the intellectual
  merit involved in other research thrusts.

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to broader
impacts.

Impact in terms of introducing creative and transformative concepts is
satisfactory as described above. PI has a demonstrated track record of
transfering complex verification technology to industry and
commercializing it. The proposed work could be of interest to DARPA
too. The educational, mentorship, and outreach plans are satisfactory.

ePlease evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with
respect to any additional solicitation-specific review criteria, if
applicable


Summary Statement

Considering the transformative potential of the proposed research the
PI qualifications to execute the vision, I am happy to rate the
proposal E.

Proposal Review 4 : 2312365
Rating: Multiple Rating: (Excellent/Very Good)

Review
Summary

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to intellectual
merit.

This proposal intends to certify new elements of C's toolchain and to
extend the current capacities of its certified components.  In
particular, it aims at making each element more modular, by improving
the memory model and integrating heterogeneous elements, and at
extending the toolchain to generate certified binary machine code and
to integrate concurrency.

Strengths:

- Developing a verified compilation toolchain as exposed in the
  proposal is extremely bold, and tackling all the problems discussed
  at once is very ambitious. However, the various elements and tasks
  identified by the PIs are clearly articulated, re-inforce each
  others, and should indeed allow moving from whole-program compilers
  to a more modular approach.

- Integrating recent advances in game semantics into CompCert is
  likely to enable significant progress and more flexibility, that
  will trickle down not only on the other tasks identified by the
  proposal, but more largely in the community as well.

- The nominal memory model is simple enough to be implemented and
  verified, but flexible enough to provide a real added expressivity
  to CompCert. The "inflexibilities" identified in 3.2 are actual
  limitations of the current model that further impediment progress
  e.g., on adding threading features. How those issues are related,
  how the proposal can bypass them, and how the solution exposed in
  the proposal will address them, are clearly detailed.

- Obtaining a certified linker and loader is a difficult goal, but the
  proposal supports a way of at least attempting something new to
  solve this problem.

- The evaluation and integration plan is convincing, in particular
  targeting the CertiKOS kernel seems at the same time realistic and
  impactful.

- The PIs are well qualified to carry out the proposed research, and
  have access to all the adequate resources to complete it.

Weaknesses:

- The proposal is ambitious and contains many interesting ideas, but
  maybe focusing on a subset of those could allow the research to be
  more impactful.

- No mitigation plan is presented: my understanding is that much of
  the work will rely on the success of tasks 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d, and
  even if the proposal is detailed enough to improve confidence, a
  mitigation plan would have improved the schedule and milestones
  section.

- No detail provided on how the tasks will be split between the
  students and the PIs: will all the participants work on all aspects
  at the same time? The tasks seem generally interwoven, so a plan on
  how the work can be parallelized (that could have been part of the
  Collaboration plan) would have improved the proposal.

In the context of the five review elements, please evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with respect to broader
impacts.

It is difficult to exaggerate the impact of certifying the C
toolchain, especially since its users need not to be knowledgeable in
certifying techniques to benefit from it. However, training students
and young scientists to certify their program will have ever-lasting
effects on the quality and resiliency of tomorrow's programs.

Strengths:

- Section 6 (Evaluation and Integration) very clearly lays out the
  necessary steps to implement the proposal's results into usable and
  transformative tools.

- Obtaining a verified software toolchain from the kernel to
  user-level applications will impact programs security and
  reliability at large.

- Developing course material for both the graduate and undergraduate
  levels on program certification and game semantics will ease the
  training of a generation of students with highly sought-after
  skills.

- The PIs are qualified to carry out the proposed activities, and have
  access to all the adequate resources to complete it.

Weaknesses:

- Since the software development component of this proposal is quite
  important, more details on the software-engineering choices, tools
  and licences would have been appreciated.

Please evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal with
respect to any additional solicitation-specific review criteria, if
applicable

Regarding the BPC:

- Goal and Context: Does the plan describe a goal and the data from
  your institution(s) or local community that justifies that goal? YES

- Intended population(s): Does the plan identify the characteristics
  of participants from an underrepresented group, including school
  level (e.g., African American undergraduates or female high-school
  students)? YES

- Strategy: Does the plan describe activities that address the stated
  goal(s) and intended population(s)? YES

- Measurement: Is there a plan to measure the outcome(s) of the activities? YES

- PI Engagement: Is there a clear role for each PI and co-PI? Does the
  plan describe how the PI is prepared (or will prepare or
  collaborate) to do the proposed work? YES


Regarding the collaboration plan: the collaboration plan requires
intense collaboration between the PIs on all tasks, and joint advising
of the students is planned. The PIs have good complementary skills,
but more concrete details on the modality and goals of their meetings
would have been appreciated. As far as I could see, visits, even short
term ones, are not planned, but could benefit the project.


Summary Statement

This proposal aims at addressing a series of difficult challenges
regarding the certification of C's toolchain by leveraging original
ideas from game semantics and the PIs expertise on closely related
themes.  The proposal sketches precisely a global approach that is
ambitious (as it addresses many different problems at the same time),
potentially transformative (as it will modularize certified elements
of a vast toolchain, and will be implemented in relevant tools) but
achievable in the given timeline (given the PIs expertise, and their
fruitful intuitions about memory models and game semantics).  The
proposal furthermore provides convincing definitions and relevant
examples to finish grounding its ideas into a concrete plan of action.
More details regarding how the tasks could be divided or mitigated in
case of failure would have improved this proposal.
