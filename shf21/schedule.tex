\section{Schedule and Milestones}

A detailed schedule of milestones are described as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
 \item {\bf Year 1}: Implement a prototype of the whole
   tool chain including REFUEL-DeepSEA, Thin-ROS, VeriFlat, VeriHyp,
   CEE-CertiKOS.
   Implement $>60\%$ of language and tool features with 70-80\% performance
   improvement. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     
 \item {\bf Year 2}: Finish a more complete version of
   the above tool chains and test them on the UGV/UAV case study.  % is this the same case study as the transition case study for phase 3 or something else?
   Implement $>80\%$ of language and tool features with 80-95\% performance
   improvement. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     
\item {\bf Year 3}: Rigorously test the tools and extend
  to support industrial settings. Implement $>99\%$ of language and tool
  features with $>100-200\%$ performance improvement.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    
\item {\bf Year 4}: Rigorously test the tools and extend
  to support industrial settings. Implement $>99\%$ of language and tool
  features with $>100-200\%$ performance improvement.
