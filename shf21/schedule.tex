A detailed schedule of milestones are described as follows.
We will work on Tasks 1a, 1b, 1c throughout the duration of the project,
making necessary adjustments as we progress on other tasks
which depend on them.
In Year 1, 
we will complete Tasks 2a and 2b to
create an initial version of Nominal CompCertO for open programs,

In Year 2, we will complete Tasks 2c, 3a, 4a, and
develop a prototype version of 3b and 4b.
