\section{Evaluation and Integration}

Talk more about supporting CCAL, CertiKOS, and DeepSEA


\paragraph*{Task 5a: CompCertX-style linking of CCAL layers (c and assembly layers).}
blah blah blah.

\paragraph*{Task 5b: End-to-end security-preserving refinement for CertiKOS.}
blah blah blah.

\paragraph*{Task 5c: Develop the DeepSEA backend and VST backend for building end-to-end verified user-level application on certified OS kernels.}
blah blah blah.


PIs should include a plan to evaluate the approaches developed as part
of the Project Description. Appropriate methods will depend on the
research area, topic, size and scope of the proposed project. Examples
include, but are not limited to, peer review of developed theories and
proofs, controlled experiments on appropriate
simulators/emulators/testbeds, user studies, or prototype
deployments. The plan should be appropriate for the size and scope of
the project.
