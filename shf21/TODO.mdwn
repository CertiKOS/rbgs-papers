# Changes to the proposal for 2022

## Angle

Since some reviewers thought that the proposal read too much as "we've done these
things and for each one we will do a bit more" and that our story for how the
pieces fit together was more about engineering and less about research, I think
one way we can address this is to make the following narrative more explicit:

  * Here is our compositional certified compiler CompCertO
  * It has an interesting "applied semantics" angle (which one review liked)
    and opens up new questions for compositional semantics.
  * Incorporating our other work into it raises interesting and difficult
    questions which will yield even more insight in that direction.

The PLDI submission could be helpful in this regard since it also talks about
high-level structures that are involved in "semantics for verification".

## Questions

I also wonder if concurrency or at least multi-thread could be a more developed
part of the proposal. I can write about the problems of the existing CompCertO
model in this context (ie. asymmetry of call/return, no linkage between
successive external calls, whereas 'yield' flips around what is happening).

One other thing that could be useful would be to emphasize the multi-threading/
concurrency aspect more: beyond task 1c and the nominal memory aspect, how it
fits within CompCertO, challenges for CompCertO+CCAL.

## Tasks

  * Fix some typos, etc that I noticed while reading through again
  * Move some of the introductory content about CompCertO to ยง1
  * Update the "Intellectual Merit" subsection:
      - #1 is already done to an extent, so maybe need to reframe
      - #2 similar, reframe a bit as "make nominal mem. work w/ CompCertO techniques"
      - #3 looks good the way it is
      - #4 maybe italicize "heterogeneous" to emphasize what's new
      - #5 maybe "verified compiler" -> "compositional verification framework"
  * Incorporate some of the PLDI submission into ยง2
  * For each of ยง3, ยง4:
      - make sure we discuss the kinks of incoporating into CompCertO more
	prominently (for example, structural injections and compositionality)
      - 

  * Go over any the specific comments in the reviews that can be addressed
    "locally"
