## project summary (1 page)

CompCert has been around for more than 10 years. It is one of the
most ... However, it has not been used for building realistic systems
because of the following limitations:

- not compositional 
- not end-to-end
- not supporting secure compilation

PI Shao's group has been leading multiple efforts on
improving CompCert to address these features. However, they have
not been combined together into a single compiler.

There are a few interesting new opportunities on how to build
a truly compositional CompCert that is end-to-end and security-presering.
  
We propose to address these problems by focusing on the following
techniques:

- CompCertO + Nominal Stack-Aware CompCert

- CompCertELF + CompCertO

- CompCertOX for Certified Abstraction Layer

- Fully Abstract Compilation and Robustly Safe Compilation
