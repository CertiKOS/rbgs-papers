## project summary (1 page)

CompCert has been around for more than 10 years. It is one of the
most ... However, it has not been used for building realistic systems
because of the following limitations:

- not compositional 
- not end-to-end
- not supporting secure compilation

PI Shao's group has been leading multiple efforts on
improving CompCert to address these features. However, they have
not been combined together into a single compiler.
There are a few interesting new opportunities on how to build
a truly compositional CompCert that is end-to-end and security-presering.
  
We propose to address these problems by focusing on the following
techniques:

- CompCertO + Nominal Stack-Aware CompCert
- CompCertELF + CompCertO
- CompCertOX for Certified Abstraction Layer
- Fully Abstract Compilation and Robustly Safe Compilation

## project description (15 pages)

- Introduction

- Task 1: Compositional Verified Compilation via CompCertO

- Task 2: Verified Compilation with a Nominal Memory Model 

- Task 3: Verified Compilation into ELF Object Files
          (Stack-Aware Assembler via CompCertELF)

- Task 4: Verified Secure Compilation 
    (CompCertOX + Full Abstraction + Robustly Secure Compilation)

- Task 5: Evaluation and Integration
    Talk more about supporting CCAL, CertiKOS, and DeepSEA

PIs should include a plan to evaluate the approaches developed as part
of the Project Description. Appropriate methods will depend on the
research area, topic, size and scope of the proposed project. Examples
include, but are not limited to, peer review of developed theories and
proofs, controlled experiments on appropriate
simulators/emulators/testbeds, user studies, or prototype
deployments. The plan should be appropriate for the size and scope of
the project.
