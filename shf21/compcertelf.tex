\section{Compositional Verified Compilation into ELF Object Files}

Together with his students, PI Shao has recently developed
CompCertELF~\cite{compcertelf20}, the first extension to CompCert that
supports verified compilation from C programs all the way to a
standard binary file format, i.e., the ELF object format.
Unfortunately, CompCertELF only supports verified separate
compilation~\cite{sepcompcert} which cannot handle linking of
heterogeneous components.  For this proposal, we will extend our
Nominal CompCertO to build an {\em end-to-end and compositional
  verified compiler} that can compile C components all the way into
ELF object files.

\paragraph*{Task 3a: Stack-Aware Norminal CompCertO.}
To support concrete memory layout required by the binary machine code,
we will first extend Nominal CompCertO to support compilation with a
single, continuous, and finite stack by incorporating the key ideas in
Stack-Aware CompCert~\cite{wang2019,compcertelf20}.  Stack-Aware
CompCert explicitly manages the call stack by adding a data type
called \emph{abstract stack} to memory states. The abstract stack
records the history of memory consumption incurred by stack allocation
and maintains fine-grained \emph{stack permissions}. By exploiting
that information, Stack-Aware CompCert achieves contextual compilation
of single-threaded C programs into an assembly language that is aware
of a single and finite stack.  In our structured nominal memory model,
the abstract stack can be readily absorbed into the support. We can
drop stack permissions from the abstract stack in Stack-Aware CompCert
because CompCertO already separately enforces them as part of its
reasoning framework (e.g., simulation conventions).

Furthermore, by enriching supports with multiple
abstract stacks following the idea of Stack-Aware
CompCert~\cite{wang2019}, we are able to compile multi-threaded
programs onto multi-stack machine models. These ideas will form a complete
solution to thread-safe contextual compilation needed to support
CCAL~\cite{ccal18}.
