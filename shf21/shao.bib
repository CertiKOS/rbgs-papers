  TITLE = {Safe and Flexible Dynamic Linking of Native Code},
  MONTH = sep,
  YEAR = 2000,
  ABSTRACT = {
  We present the design and implementation of the first complete framework
  for flexible and safe dynamic linking of native code.  Our approach
  extends Typed Assembly Language with a primitive for loading and
  typechecking code, which is flexible enough to support a variety of
  linking strategies, but simple enough that it does not significantly
  expand the trusted computing base.  Using this primitive, along with the
  ability to compute with types, we show that we can {\em program} many
  existing dynamic linking approaches.  As a concrete demonstration, we have
  used our framework to implement dynamic linking for a type-safe dialect of
  C, closely modeled after the standard linking facility for Unix C
  programs.  Aside from the unavoidable cost of verification, our
  implementation performs comparably with the standard, untyped approach.

                  three ideas from the academic community: parametric
                  polymorphism, higher-order functions, and algebraic
                  data types. Pizza is defined by translation into
                  Java and compiles into the Java Virtual Machine,
                  requirements which strongly constrain the design
                  space. Nonetheless, Pizza fits smoothly to Java,
                  with only a few rough edges.}

This article describes the development and formal verification (proof

imperative intermediate language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the

its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.  (Much extended and revised version of \cite{Leroy-compcert-06}.)}

obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq

back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in
