\paragraph{PI Zhong Shao -- Expeditions in Computing: The Science of Deep Specification} (CCF-1521531, \$2,062,445, 2015--2021). 
This grant is part of the collaborative DeepSpec project~\cite{deepspec} among Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Penn. 
\emph{Intellectual Merit:} 
Developed the world's first formally verified
concurrent hypervisor kernel CertiKOS which can run on Intel and AMD
multicore machines with hardware virtualization and can boot Ubuntu or
Debian Linux as guest~\cite{certikos-osdi16}. Developed a
new compositional approach for formally specifying, verifying, and
compiling sequential and concurrent abstraction
layers~\cite{chen16,costanzo16,certikos-osdi16,ccal18,compcerto,wang2019,koenig20}.
Connected CertiKOS with a verified web server
developed by the Penn \& Princeton teams.
\emph{Broader Impacts:} 
Hosted outreach workshops and two DeepSpec summer schools (each with
150 attendees); incorporated CertiKOS into the undergraduate OS
classes at several institutions; PI Shao cofounded a new blockchain startup
(CertiK) which applies formal verification technologies to smart
contracts and blockchain ecosystems; the CertiKOS technologies has
also been used to verify a secure KVM hypervisor in the mainstream
Linux/KVM ecosystems.  {\em Representative Publications} include one
CACM research highlight~\cite{certikos-cacm19}, four
POPL~\cite{wang2019,liu-popl20,wang2022,layered22} papers, four
PLDI~\cite{chen16,costanzo16,ccal18,compcerto}, three
OOPSLA~\cite{deepsea19,compcertelf20,ado21}, one LICS~\cite{koenig20},
and one OSDI~\cite{certikos-osdi16}.
