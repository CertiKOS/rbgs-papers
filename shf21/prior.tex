\paragraph{PI Zhong Shao -- Expeditions in Computing: The Science of Deep Specification} (CCF-1521531, \$2,062,445, 2015--2021). 
This grant is part of the collaborative DeepSpec project~\cite{deepspec} among Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Penn. 
\emph{Intellectual Merit:} 
Developed the world's first formally verified
concurrent hypervisor kernel CertiKOS which can run on Intel and AMD
multicore machines and can boot Linux as guest~\cite{certikos-osdi16}. Developed a
new compositional approach for formally specifying, verifying, and
compiling sequential and concurrent abstraction
layers~\cite{chen16,costanzo16,certikos-osdi16,ccal18,compcerto,wang2019,koenig20}.
Connected CertiKOS with a verified web server
developed by the Penn \& Princeton teams.
\emph{Broader Impacts:} 
Hosted outreach workshops and two DeepSpec summer schools (each with
150 attendees); incorporated CertiKOS into the undergraduate OS
classes at several institutions; PI Shao cofounded a new blockchain startup
(CertiK) focusing on formal verification of smart contracts.
{\em Representative Publications} include one
CACM research highlight~\cite{certikos-cacm19}, four
POPL~\cite{wang2019,liu-popl20,wang2022,layered22} papers, four
PLDI~\cite{chen16,costanzo16,ccal18,compcerto}, three
OOPSLA~\cite{deepsea19,compcertelf20,ado21}, one LICS~\cite{koenig20},
and one OSDI~\cite{certikos-osdi16}.
