## Summary

We are grateful to the reviewers for their hard work.
We have found the reviews to be extremely fair, useful and constructive,
and to be candid our proposed change list below is for the most part a summary
of the suggestions they have offered.

Nevertheless, in the remainder of our response we will address first issues
which common to multiple reviews, then address each one point-by-point.

## Change List

To address the reviewer's feedback, we will make the following changes:

 1. Expand the introduction as suggested by Reviews XXX and YYY.
    In particular, we will include a summary of the paper's structure
    at the end of §1.2. We will be sure to incorporate additional "goal posts"
    throughout the paper and especially at the beginning of each section.
 2. Spell out explicitly the categorical definitions we use,
    as they apply to our particular cases.
 3. Explain and illustrate our use of string diagrams in more depth.
 4. Include more material regarding memory separation, ClightP semantics,
    and the ClightP composition proof in the main body of the paper.
    (This will also contribute toward #3, as we used string diagrams
    extensively in working out this proof.)
 5. Provide a reference for lenses and expand the Related Work section,
    in particular we include a more detailed comparison of our work with
    interaction trees and with recent work on certified abstraction layers.

More generally, we have found the reviewers' observations and suggestions
to be excellent. The questions they raise also underscore places in the paper
where explanatory text was missing or where more context would have been
helpful. Therefore, when it makes sense, we will try to incorporate our
detailed comments below as much as possible.

## Common issues

### Role of category theory

Several reviewers express understandable skepticism regarding the use of
category theory and string diagrams in presenting the work, especially since
the work itself does not rely on any very advanced category theory results.
Our rationale for choosing this approach is the following.

Category theory was a crucial structural tool in investigating and developing
the framework presented in the paper. Whenever we would figure out how to
incorporate a new aspect, CT would provide a way to elucidate the underlying
structures and put them in a form which would provide a solid foundation for
further work. For example:

  * Very little of the work would have worked but for our move from CompCertO's
    $\oplus$ composition to the layered composition operator $\odot$, which is
    better-behaved and in our estimation is more fundamental.

  * Analyzing the construction $A \mathbin@ U$ found in Koenig & Shao [2020]
    in this way is what led us to extend it from a unary functor ${-} \mathbin@ U$
    which could only use a fixed set $U$, into a full-blown spatial composition
    operator, compatible with double categorical structures in both arguments,
    and to introduce lenses into our framework in order to accomplish this.

We believe from this experience that, given the overall complexity of the
framework, making the underlying organizing principles explicit is necessary
to help the reader grasp the ways in which the many ingredients listed in
Table 1 fit with one another. At the same time, we wanted to do this in a way
which did not assume the reader was already familiar with higher or double
category theory (but which would still identify them explicitly to the readers
which were).

This is admittedly a tight rope to walk, in part because of the "double bind"
noted by Reviewer A, and despite our efforts the paper remains difficult and
obscure in places. However the review lead us to believe that we did get some
of the way there and we are optimistic that by taking into account the
reviewers' feedback we would be able to walk it in the revised version.

### String diagrams

On a related note, the reviewers also express uncertainty as to the usefulness
of string diagrams, and whether introducing them brings benefits in excess of
their complexity and unfamiliarity.

There again, we included string diagrams because we found them to be necessary
in carrying out the work. Three-dimensional diagrams in particular, although
they are complex, are an incredible resource when constructing refinement
proofs which involve all three composition principles in intertwined ways.
As an exemple, we do not believe we could have written (or frankly, could read
back) the proof term given at the end of §3.4 (l.652) without using them at
least as a mental visualization tool for the underlying structure.

In fact, the mechanics of 3D diagrams essentially capture the entirety of the
framework's compositional structure and associated rules. Figuring out how to
draw them and how they worked was a watershed moment in wrapping our own minds
around that compositional structure, and we would like to provide the same
level of insight to the reader.

At the same time, we acknowledge that while Example 3.9 gives a taste of the
mechanics of such refinement cubes, the paper currently does a poor job of
explaining how they work, and that this would need to be addressed in a final
version (as a starting point we provide some additional illustration and
rationale for their use in our answer to Reviewer A).
On the other hand, 2D string diagrams for simulation proofs
(as opposed to those used for transition systems and simulation conventions)
could be deemphasized --- while they were intended as a stepping stone,
it seems the reviewers did not get much out of them.

### Unexplained conventions

In several places in the paper we use
the unexplained notation $L_1 \le L_2$
to mean $L_1 \le_{\mathsf{id}_A \twoheadrightarrow \mathsf{id}_B} L_2$,
ie. a simulation property where both conventions are identities,
since in that case simulation properties reduces to a more traditional
preorder among objects of type $L_1, L_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
This is similar in spirit to the relation $R \sqsubseteq S$ defined for
simulation conventions as
$\mathsf{id}_A \le_{R \twoheadrightarrow S} \mathsf{id}_B$ on l.936.

We will make sure this convention is properly introduced
before its first use.

### Related work and comparison with prior work

We acknowledge the paper need to do a better job of citing source and comparing
our work with other refinement frameworks, as pointed out by several reviewers,
and will be sure to address thoses issues in any revision.

[Not sure if there's a good way to address this
but it seems other reviewers would disagree]

This is not true for the string diagrams used for
transition systems or simulation conventions.
For transition systems of a given type
under simple refinement $\le$,
we could reason in the traditional way by writing things such as:

> $L = [\text{diagram 1}] \le \cdots \le [\text{diagram n}] \le L' \qquad (1)$

As usual,
the diagrams would capture geometrically the identities
arising from the categorical structure,
and the congruence properties of $\le$ would allow us to
apply local refinements.
A similar story holds for simulation conventions of a given type
under the relation $\sqsubseteq$ defined on l. 

However,
when both kinds of objects are involved,
this approach is no longer sufficient,
and this is where our 3-dimensional diagrams come in.
There,
a refinement of the form $L_1 \le L_2$
corresponds to a cube where only
the top ($L_1$) and bottom ($L_2$) faces
have non-trivial contents.
A refinement sequence such as (1)
corresponds to stacking such cubes together vertically,
where [diagram 1] ... [diagram n] would be the
contents of the horizontal faces connecting them.
Likewise,
a refinement sequence
$\textbf{R} = [\text{diagram 1}]
 \sqsubseteq \cdots \sqsubseteq
 [\text{diagram n}] = \mathbf{S}$
would correspond to stacking cubes sideways,
with the diagrams 1..n occupying the
left, right and intermediate faces.

But as illustrated by Example 3.9,
our framework also makes it possible
to go beyond this kind of equational reasoning
and to compose such refinement cubes
in the three possible directions.

[to be clarified above]

[ack]

> This might be true for Clight semantics but it does not hold for Assembly, does it?

We believe this should be true for CompCertO's Asm language as well,
as it is closely related to the parametricity property established in
Theorem 4.3 of the CompCertO paper (and proved in `x86/Asmrel.v`).

We agree with that and would use some extra space to discuss ClightP in more
detail, including some of the material touched on in Appendix C. The ClightP
composition proof is also an additional example of a property which would have
been difficult for us to prove and wrap our head around without the use of
string diagrams.

[see above]

> Questions to be addressed by author response
> --------------------------------------------
> - Please explain how the "fundamental property" results in representation independence in terms of program equivalences.

Suppose we have two components
$f_1, f_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
The first is defined using an internal state of type $U$
as $f_1 := [ u \rangle \odot L_1$,
where $u \in U$ is the initial state
and $L_1 : A \twoheadrightarrow B @ U$
describes the behavior of each activation
in terms of this internal state.
Likewise $f_2 := [ v \rangle \odot L_2$ with
$v \in V$ and
$L_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ V$.
Components of this kind may result, for example,
from interpreting two ClightP program
which use different sets of private variables
to store their internal state.

To show that $f_1, f_2$ have the same externally observable behavior,
we can exhibit a relation $R \subseteq U \times V$
such that:

  1. $\zeta : u \mathbin{R} v$ holds for initial states;
  2. If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are invoked with related states,
     they will exhibit the same behavior and
     their updated states will again be related by $R$.

The latter can be expressed by the properties
$\phi : L_1 \le_{A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ R} L_2$ and
$\phi' : L_2 \le_{A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ R^{\kw{op}}} L_1$,
from which we can derive the refinement properties
$[\zeta \rangle \odot \phi : f_1 \le f_2$ and
$[\zeta^\mathsf{op} \rangle \cdot \phi' : f_2 \le f_1$.

We acknowledge the paper would benefit from improving "goal posts"
significantly and will do that.

[discuss in the common part: although our "process" relied heavily on category
theory we wanted the paper to be accessible to readers with no background and
to not rely explicitly on categorical definitions, while at the same mentioning
them to 1. acknowledge where the ideas are comming from 2. help readers who are
familiar with CT connect the dots and 3. point intested readers in that
direction if they want to learn more.  This is quite challenging and we acknowledge we didn't entirely succeed, with that said the reviews lead us to believe that we got some of the way there and we believe the reviewers' feedback will help us with the last mile in the final version.]

>   3. 5.2 and 5.3 are significantly harder than the remaining of the paper with a light categorical background. It is deep enough in the paper to be acceptable though.

We acknowledge this and would do our best to use any extra space to improve
these sections in the final version.

> * The related work, and in general citations, are quite insufficient! The authors make heavy use of lenses, but do not cite a single work about them for instance!
>   In the related work, some comparisons are quite devoid of content (Interaction Trees notably).

As discussed in the common part, category theory and string diagrams were
important tools for carrying out the work

> A big question mark for me is what the language of category theory really brought to the table.  Is it just that things are "less ad-hoc", as the authors state, and more systematic? That is nice, but I would love to see more tangible advantages in terms of making the task of verification faster and more efficient; for example, in Turi and Plotkin's categorical framework for operational semantics [1], one gets compositionality proofs for free as a consequence of naturality.
> 
> There is a substantial notational overhead that, in combination with the overhead associated to category theory, makes reading this dense paper a challenge. I feel like by 5.2 the complexity has grown to very high levels, which is reflected in the section's result. Presenting spatial composition as a double bifunctor between TSC and LSC (the latter being largely a mathematical artifact?) has buried the useful properties of spatial composition under a sea of definitions that have to be unfolded. Moreover, there is no effort to help the reader in that regard whatsoever.
