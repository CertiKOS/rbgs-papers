## Summary

We are grateful to the reviewers for their hard work.
We have found the reviews to be extremely fair, useful and constructive,
and to be candid our proposed change list below is for the most part a summary
of the suggestions they have offered.

Below this, we address the reviewers' "official" questions, as well as some
observations and questions which appeared across multiple reviews.
Finally we provide a point-by-point response for the remaining contents of
individual reviews.

## Change list

To address the reviewer's feedback, we will make the following changes:

 1. *Fix the issues with the introduction* noted by Reviewers A and B.
    In particular, we will include a summary of the paper's structure
    at the end of §1.2. We will be sure to incorporate additional "goal posts"
    throughout the paper and especially at the beginning of each section.
 2. *Provide definitions for relevant categorical concepts* (monoidal category,
    double category, etc) as they apply to our particular cases.
    In particular we will make sure to provide "inference rule" style
    versions of each one of the framework's composition properties,
    which our audience is more likely to be comfortable with.
 3. *Explain and illustrate our use of string diagrams* in more depth
    (see below and our response to Reviewer A).
 4. *Include more material regarding memory separation, ClightP* semantics,
    and the ClightP composition proof in the main body of the paper.
    (This will also contribute toward #3, as we used string diagrams
    extensively in working out this proof.)
 5. *Provide a reference for lenses and expand the Related Work section*,
    in particular we will include a more detailed comparison of our work with
    interaction trees and with recent work on certified abstraction layers.

More generally, we have found the reviewers' observations, suggestions and
questions to be excellent, and where it makes sense, we will try to incorporate
our detailed comments below as much as possible.

## Common issues and key questions

### Conceptual novelty vs. prior work

**Reviewer D** asks:
> What conceptual contributions does this work bring over the previous
> theoretical work by Koenig and Shao [LICS 2020] and Oliveira Vale et al.
> [POPL 2022]? For instance, are the layered composition operator or any of the
> spatial composition operators new to the current submission?

First, let's spell out the commonalities between these two papers
and our submission:

  * All of them propose a model of Certified Abstraction Layers
  * In all of them, a type of the form $A \rightarrow B$ is used for
    a component which accepts incoming calls in $B$ and performs
    outgoing calls in $A$, and all use a composition of the form $g \odot f$
    which lets $f$ and $g$ interact by having the outgoing calls of $g$
    handled as incoming calls of $f$. In that sense the layer composition
    operator is not new to the current submission.

However, both these papers differ from our submission in the following ways:

  * They use trace-based semantics, whereas we are repurposing the
    transition systems of CompCertO.
  * The are pen-and-paper models only whereas our work has been mechanized in
    the Coq proof assistant.
  * The model in our submission supports (an extended version of) CompCertO's
    simulation conventions, whereas each of these two papers
    have their own mechanisms for data abstraction. These mechanisms only apply to
    component states, but not to the shape of function calls and returns
    (as defined by effect signatures $\simeq$ language interfaces):

      + in the POPL paper, the specification model supports encapsulated state,
        and as such includes representation indepdence facilities.
      + in the LICS paper, a relation $R \subseteq U \times V$ can be used to
        induce a formal adjunction of type
        $A \mathbin@ U \leftrightarrows A \mathbin@ U$
        but there are is no way to express relationships between the
        different effect signatures (language interfaces) $A$ and $B$

On that last point, the $\mathbin@$ construction used in the LICS paper
is only a very restricted version of our spatial composition operator.
It consists only of a unary functor ${-} \mathbin@ U$ operating in the context
of a fixed set $U$, similarly to the special case we describe on ll. 480--490
to introduce our own version. The ambition is only is simply to transparently
"pass through" the state used in an underlay interface, and perhaps transform
it through simple relational abstraction as described above
(through that happens through a construction distinct from $\mathbin@$).

However, in our case the construction extends to full-blown, binary spatial
composition operator, which can act on every kind of object listed in Table 1
(subject to the restriction that language interfaces and transition systems
can only appear on the left).

### Role of category theory

Several reviewers express understandable skepticism regarding the use of
category theory and string diagrams in presenting the work, especially since
the work itself does not rely on any very advanced category theory results.
Our rationale for choosing this approach is the following.

Category theory was a crucial structural tool in investigating and developing
the framework presented in the paper. Whenever we would figure out how to
incorporate a new aspect, we would use it to help us elucidate the underlying
structures and put them in a form which would provide a solid foundation for
further work. For example:

  * Very little of the work would have worked but for our move from CompCertO's
    $\oplus$ composition to the layered composition operator $\odot$, which is
    better-behaved and in our estimation is more fundamental.

  * Analyzing the construction $A \mathbin@ U$ found in Koenig & Shao [2020]
    with a higher-categorical perspective is what allowed us to perform the
    generalization the we have described above, 
    introduce lenses into our framework in order to accomplish this.

We believe from this experience that, given the overall complexity of the
framework, making the underlying organizing principles explicit is important
to help the reader grasp the ways in which the many ingredients listed in
Table 1 fit with one another. At the same time, we wanted to do this in a way
which did not assume the reader was already familiar with higher or double
category theory (but which would still identify them explicitly to the readers
which were).

This is admittedly a tight rope to walk, in part because of the "double bind"
noted by Reviewer A, and despite our efforts the paper remains difficult and
obscure in places. In particular, while some of the structural composition
properties are spelled out in the text in "inference rule" style 

However, the reviewers' input lead us to believe that we did get some
of the way there, and we are optimistic that by taking into account
their observations and advice we would be able to walk it in a final version.

### String diagrams

On a related note, the reviewers also express uncertainty as to the usefulness
of string diagrams, and whether introducing them brings benefits in excess of
their complexity and unfamiliarity.

**Reviewer B** asks:
> In your experience, do you believe that string diagrams in the context of
> realistic refinement proofs as presented here can be a useful tool to the
> practitioner, or are they merely an interesting oddity?

There again, we included string diagrams because we found them to be necessary
in carrying out the work. Three-dimensional diagrams in particular, although
they are complex, are an incredible resource when constructing refinement
proofs which involve all three composition principles in intertwined ways.
As an example, we do not believe we could have written (or frankly, could read
back) the proof term given at the end of §3.4 (l.652) without using them at
least as a mental visualization tool for the underlying structure.

In fact, the mechanics of 3D diagrams essentially capture the entirety of the
framework's compositional structure and associated rules. Figuring out how to
draw them and how they worked was a watershed moment in wrapping our own minds
around that compositional structure, and we would like to provide the same
level of insight to the reader.

At the same time, we acknowledge that while Example 3.9 gives a taste of the
mechanics of such refinement cubes, the paper currently does a poor job of
explaining how they work, and that this would need to be addressed in a final
version (as a starting point we provide some additional illustration and
rationale for their use in our answer to Reviewer A).
On the other hand, 2D string diagrams for simulation proofs
(as opposed to those used for transition systems and simulation conventions)
could be deemphasized --- while they were intended as a stepping stone,
it seems the reviewers did not get much out of them.

### Representation Independence

**Reviewer A** asks:
> Please explain how the "fundamental property" results in representation
> independence in terms of program equivalences.

Suppose we have two components
$f_1, f_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
The first is defined using an internal state of type $U$
as $f_1 := [ u \rangle \odot L_1$,
where $u \in U$ is the initial state
and $L_1 : A \twoheadrightarrow B @ U$
describes the behavior of each activation
in terms of this internal state.
Likewise $f_2 := [ v \rangle \odot L_2$ with
$v \in V$ and
$L_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ V$.
Components of this kind may result, for example,
from interpreting two ClightP program
which use different sets of private variables
to store their internal state.

To show that $f_1, f_2$ have the same externally observable behavior,
we can exhibit a relation $R \subseteq U \times V$
such that:

  1. $\zeta : u \mathbin{R} v$ holds for initial states;
  2. If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are invoked with related states,
     they will exhibit the same behavior and
     their updated states will again be related by $R$.

The latter can be expressed by the properties
$\phi : L_1 \le_{A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ R} L_2$ and
$\phi' : L_2 \le_{A \twoheadrightarrow B \mathbin@ R^\kw{op}} L_2$,
from which we can derive the refinement properties
$[\zeta \rangle \odot \phi : f_1 \le f_2$ and
$[\zeta^\mathsf{op} \rangle \cdot \phi' : f_2 \le f_1$.

### Unexplained conventions

As noted by **Reviewer A**,
in several places in the paper we use
the unexplained notation $L_1 \le L_2$
to mean $L_1 \le_{\mathsf{id}_A \twoheadrightarrow \mathsf{id}_B} L_2$,
ie. a simulation property where both conventions are identities,
since in that case simulation properties reduces to a more traditional
preorder among objects of type $L_1, L_2 : A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
This is similar in spirit to the relation $R \sqsubseteq S$ defined for
simulation conventions as
$\mathsf{id}_A \le_{R \twoheadrightarrow S} \mathsf{id}_B$ on l.936.

We will make sure this convention is properly introduced
before its first use.

This is not true for the string diagrams used for
transition systems or simulation conventions.
For transition systems of a given type
under simple refinement $\le$,
we could reason in the traditional way by writing things such as:

> $L = [\text{diagram 1}] \le \cdots \le [\text{diagram n}] \le L' \qquad (1)$

As usual,
the diagrams would capture geometrically the identities
arising from the categorical structure,
and the congruence properties of $\le$ would allow us to
apply local refinements.
A similar story holds for simulation conventions of a given type
under the relation $\sqsubseteq$ defined on l. 

However,
when both kinds of objects are involved,
this approach is no longer sufficient,
and this is where our 3-dimensional diagrams come in.
There,
a refinement of the form $L_1 \le L_2$
corresponds to a cube where only
the top ($L_1$) and bottom ($L_2$) faces
have non-trivial contents.
A refinement sequence such as (1)
corresponds to stacking such cubes together vertically,
where [diagram 1] ... [diagram n] would be the
contents of the horizontal faces connecting them.
Likewise,
a refinement sequence
$\textbf{R} = [\text{diagram 1}]
 \sqsubseteq \cdots \sqsubseteq
 [\text{diagram n}] = \mathbf{S}$
would correspond to stacking cubes sideways,
with the diagrams 1..n occupying the
left, right and intermediate faces.

But as illustrated by Example 3.9,
our framework also makes it possible
to go beyond this kind of equational reasoning
and to compose such refinement cubes
in the three possible directions.

[ack]

[XXX Check with Yu:]
We believe this should be true for CompCertO's Asm language as well,
as it is closely related to the parametricity property established in
Theorem 4.3 of the CompCertO paper (and proved in `x86/Asmrel.v`).

We agree with that and would use some extra space to discuss ClightP in more
detail, including some of the material touched on in Appendix C. The ClightP
composition proof is also an additional example of a property which would have
been difficult for us to prove and wrap our head around without the use of
string diagrams.

We acknowledge the paper would benefit from improving "goal posts"
significantly and will do that.

[discuss in the common part: although our "process" relied heavily on category
theory we wanted the paper to be accessible to readers with no background and
to not rely explicitly on categorical definitions, while at the same mentioning
them to 1. acknowledge where the ideas are comming from 2. help readers who are
familiar with CT connect the dots and 3. point intested readers in that
direction if they want to learn more.  This is quite challenging and we acknowledge we didn't entirely succeed, with that said the reviews lead us to believe that we got some of the way there and we believe the reviewers' feedback will help us with the last mile in the final version.]

>   3. 5.2 and 5.3 are significantly harder than the remaining of the paper with a light categorical background. It is deep enough in the paper to be acceptable though.

We acknowledge this and would do our best to use any extra space to improve
these sections in the final version.

That is nice, but I would love to see more tangible advantages in terms of making the task of verification faster and more efficient; for example, in Turi and Plotkin's categorical framework for operational semantics [1], one gets compositionality proofs for free as a consequence of naturality.

> There is a substantial notational overhead that, in combination with the overhead associated to category theory, makes reading this dense paper a challenge. I feel like by 5.2 the complexity has grown to very high levels, which is reflected in the section's result. Presenting spatial composition as a double bifunctor between TSC and LSC (the latter being largely a mathematical artifact?) has buried the useful properties of spatial composition under a sea of definitions that have to be unfolded. Moreover, there is no effort to help the reader in that regard whatsoever.

> Assessment of the paper
> -----------------------
> ## Positive
> 
> + The paper addresses a real practical need for more compositional semantics in
>   verification and certified compilation.
> 
> + The proposed compositional semantic framework seems general, elegant, and
>   practically useful. In particular, the paper generalizes CompCertO with the
>   ability to compose languages with different language interfaces. It also adds
>   data abstraction and state encapsulation to CompCertO using a family of
>   spatial composition combinators working at various levels (language
>   interfaces, transition systems, simulations).
> 
> + The proposed framework was used to simplify and put on stronger foundations
>   the theory of certified abstraction layers from CompCertX. In a sequential
>   setting (so without concurrency) the proposed extension of CompCertO seems
>   in fact like a good replacement for CompCertX?
> 
> + This was all implemented in Coq as an extension of CompCertO and was provided
>   as a supplementary material. I was able to build this Coq development and it
>   seems to match the claims of the paper. The development seems elegant and
>   relatively small, but still seems a nontrivial amount of work.
> 
> + The paper is reasonably accessible even for someone who knows little about
>   category theory. In particular the use of the simple but concrete running
>   example in Sections 2 and 3 helps a lot, and the introduced concepts are well
>   motivated by this example, at least until right after Example 3.4 on pg 11.
> 
> ## Negative
> 
> - It is unclear from the submission whether it brings significant conceptual
>   contributions over a previous theoretical work by Koenig and Shao [LICS 2020]
>   and maybe also more recent work by Oliveira Vale et al. [POPL 2022]. While
>   there is definitely value in mechanizing previous theoretical ideas in Coq and
>   bringing them to CompCert, the paper should be clearer about the relation to
>   such previous work and more explicit about any new conceptual contributions.
>   For instance, is the layered composition operator new to the current work?
>   And is any of the spatial composition operators new?
> 
> - The simple running example of Sections 2 and 3 is definitely nice for
>   exposition purposes, but it would be even better to also apply the framework
>   of this paper for verifying larger and/or more interesting programs.
> 
> - While until Example 3.4 the paper used the running example very nicely to
>   motivate upfront the need for the introduced abstract concepts, starting with
>   the lenses on page 11 the new concepts are introduced without any motivation
>   and the running example is only used after the fact. This makes pages 11-16
>   harder to follow for someone motivated more by practical applications than by
>   the beauty of category theory. More generally, it would be good if the paper
>   would more often practically motivate upfront the need for abstract category
>   theory concepts.

> -----------------------------
> ## New conceptual contributions over prior work
> 
> To add to my first negative point above, even in the places mentioning the
> previous work on which the current work builds it is still unclear what the
> precise connection is:
> - The very beginning of section 3.2 mentions that the `A @ U` construction is
>   Following Koenig and Shao [2020], but then it's unclear what else in this
>   section is taken from such prior work vs what is new. For instance on line 476
>   the paper mentions "we turn @ into a proper composition principle by
>   establishing its action on transition systems, simulation conventions and
>   simulations", but it's unclear whether this was already proposed in prior work.
> - Section 7 mentions this: "There exist more recent and abstract treatments of
>   CAL which, like our work, attempt to streamline the theory underlying the CAL
>   framework [Oliveira Vale et al. 2022]. In particular a version of the @
>   construction appears in Koenig and Shao [2020]. However this work has not been
>   mechanized or interfaced with CompCert." This text is very low on details and
>   it could be interpreted as this work being just a Coq formalization of
>   existing theoretical work. Also the reference to the "@ construction" is
>   imprecise, since there are 4 different "@" constructors in Section 3 (one for
>   each layer). Were they all already introduced in previous work?
> - The first line of Section 4 promises to start "with our extension of
>   CompCertO’s model", but then Section 4.2 talks about Kripke Relators as if
>   they were taken directly from CompCertO. So maybe the first line of Section 4
>   sets the wrong expectations?

> ## Explaining category theory to outsiders

> It would be great if the paper could explain what one gains in practice from
> viewing transition systems as a double category. For instance could you reuse

> 
> Then, while drawing 2-dimensional string diagrams seems nice and intuitive even
> for non-category theorists, that seems less the case for 3-dimensional diagrams,
> which seem much harder to understand intuitively or even to draw precisely. So

> ## ClightP component model details
> 
> The component model of ClightP could be explained in a bit more detail. For

> ## Smaller comments
