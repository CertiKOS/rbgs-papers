Things to address per PLDI comments:

  * Not understandable w/o category theory background
    + §2: introduce CT concepts through CompCert compositional structures
    + §2: make sure to introduce diagrams
  * Does not provide an evaluation
    + New section to gather example, CAL, etc.
    + Horizontal composition of layers ?
    + Example of layer composition w/ handwritten asm?
  * Clarify ⊙ vs ⊕ and mutual recusion
    + This could be part of the new §2 subsection
  * Is "verification framework" the right thing to call it?
    + Semantics framework for verification?
  * Related work:
    + CCR
    + BIP - Bensalem et al
    + Delta vs. CompCertO
    + Interaction trees
    + Exact relationship with CAL
