# Revision changes for paper #239

Thanks again for your work and feedback. We were able to make all of the
required and suggested changes in our paper's revised version.

Specifically, we addressed the required changes as follows:

> Add comparisons with all of the strands of related work mentioned in the
> rebuttal. Even with the additional space allowed for final versions, it still
> may not be possible to discuss them all at the level of detail from the
> rebuttal, so we must rely on the authors to decide how to prioritize.

We incorporated the text from the rebuttal into our Related Work section.

> Make clear in the paper what the Coq development includes and how it provides
> evidence that design decisions made were good ones.

The newly added Table 1 and §6.1 (Mechanization in the Coq proof assistant)
discuss the contents of our artifact as well as certain design choices we have
made in our implementation.

> Clarify the extent to which your work supports the UNIX processes-and-pipes
> abstraction.

We have added a new paragraph at the end of §2.6 which clarifies this.

> Explain to what extent the framework can handle refinement of a high-level
> interaction to multiple low-level interactions.

The newly added Remark 4.6 in §4.3 (Refinement Squares) incorporates the
discussion of this issue from our rebuttal.

> Clarify how your framing property is compatible with realistic C semantics,
> re: your response to Reviewer C.

We have added Remark 6.4 at the end of §6.3 (Memory Separation) 

In addition, we carried out the following suggested changes.

> Adopt Reviewer B's suggestion for how to present [the grammar of plays]

We have updated the paper to use Reviewer B's suggestion.

> All the miscellaneous suggestions from other reviews

We have made the following additional changes:

  * Mentioned recent Bedwork2-based work towards the end of §1.1
  * Fixed Definition 4.9
  * Used the notation \underline{m_1} instead of \underline{m}_1
  * Fixed typos and made small improvements to the presentation
    in various places identified by the reviewers.
