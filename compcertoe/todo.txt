Wrap up CompCertOE paper
        Polish Sec. 2
                - [x] Make sure notations are consistent
                - [x] Figure out how much of CompCertO's string diagrams we want to introduce
                - [x] Improve 2.4
                - [x] Decide on figures
                - [ ] Draw whichever string diagrams we want to keep there
        Rewrite Sec. 3
                - [ ] New treatment of active vs. passive
                Bring discussion of compositional structures in line with Sec. 2
                        - [ ] Reframe the discussion of string diagrams
                        - [ ] Introduce the 3-D string diagrams when discussing state (frame rule is good example)
        - [ ] Use the simpler proof Clight(M)@m* for Sec.6
        - [ ] Frame ClightP as more of an application and less of a contribution? Flip Sec 6 and 7?
