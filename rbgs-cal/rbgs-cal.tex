\begin{abstract} %{{{
Formal methods have advanced to the point where researchers have been
able to verify the complete functional correctness of various large
system components.  However, because these efforts often use semantic
models tailored to the verification task at hand, connecting the
resulting correctness proofs to build larger certified systems is
challenging.  We believe that a synthesis of existing research on game
semantics, the refinement calculus, and algebraic effect can provide a
general-purpose setting where the semantic models and correctness
properties of various projects can be embedded and linked together to
construct certified heterogeneous systems.

To combine game semantics and refinement, we replace the downset
completion typically used to construct strategies from posets of plays
with the \emph{free distributive completion}, to obtain \emph{strategy
  specifications} equipped with arbitrary angelic and demonic choices
and ordered by a generalization of alternating refinement.  This
provides a novel understanding of nondeterminism in the context of
game semantics and suggests a solution to long-standing issues which
have plagued game models for nondeterministic languages.

To combine algebraic effects and game semantics, we interpret effect
signatures as ground games and define the categories $\gcat^{ib}$ and
$\gcat^b$ of effect signatures and well-bracketed strategy
specifications for games of the form ${!E} \multimap F$ and ${!E}
\multimap {!F}$.  The resulting models extends the \emph{refinement
  calculus hierarchy} described by Beck and von Wright~\cite{refcal}
with algebraic effects and handlers.

To illustrate the expressivity of the resulting models, we use them to
to develop a theory of \emph{certified abstraction layers}, which builds
on the principles used in the verification of the certified OS
kernel CertiKOS~\cite{popl15}.

\section{Introduction} %{{{

% Preamble: certified software {{{

Certified software
is software accompanied by
mechanized, machine-checkable proofs of correctness.
To construct a certified program,
we must not only write its code in a given programming language,
but also formally specify its intended behavior
and construct, using specialized tools,
evidence that the program
indeed conforms to the specification.

In order to connect the program and the specification
using a formal proof,
we need a formal mathematical model of
the languages in which they are described.
The tools used to reason about them
should be sound with respect to this interpretation.
Ideally,
this will be demonstrated in an established,
general-purpose proof assistant,
diminishing the possibility that
incorrect programs will be validated because of
accidental or deliberate mistake
in the software used to construct and check proofs.

%}}}

\subsection{Certified systems at scale} %{{{

The past decade has seen an explosion
in the scope and scale of practical software verification.
Researchers have been able to produce certified
compilers \cite{compcert},
program logics \cite{vst},
OS kernels \cite{sel4,popl15},
file systems \cite{fscq} and more,
often introducing novel techniques
and mathematical models.
In this context,
there has been increasing interest in
making these components (and their proofs of correctness)
interoperable and
combining them into larger certified systems.

This is exemplified by the DeepSpec project \cite{deepspec},
which seeks to connect various components
specified and verified in the Coq proof assistant.
The key idea behind DeepSpec
is to interpret specifications as \emph{interfaces}
between components.
When a component providing a certain interface
has been verified,
client components can rely on this
for their own proofs of correctness.
Standardizing this process would make it possible
to construct large-scale certified systems
by assembling off-the-shelf certified components.

%This approach would provides benefits
%beyond the potential increase in the scale of
%practical certified system.
%As it stands,
%a certified system is only
%as trustworthy as its specification.
%Indeed,
%it is possible to prove a buggy system correct
%with respect to a buggy specification.
%If the only user of the specification
%is a human expert subjecting it to careful examination,
%these bugs could go unnoticed
%and persist in the final system.
%By contrast,
%if we attempt to use the same specification as a dependency
%in the correctness proof of a client component,
%its deficiencies will become apparent
%and prevent us from carrying out this second proof of correctness.
%Moreover,
%the internal specifications used
%as intermediate steps
%in the verification of a complex system
%disappear from the external characterization of the system,
%and no longer need to be trusted.
%This reduces the ratio between the size of the system
%and the size of the specification
%which must be trusted and understood
%to establish guarantees about the overall system.

To an extent,
these principles are already demonstrated in the structure of the
certified C compiler CompCert \cite{compcert},
where the semantics of intermediate languages
serve as intermediate specifications for each pass.
The correctness of each compilation pass is established by
proving that the behavior of its target program
refines that of its source program
(which serves in this case as the specification).
As passes are composed to obtain the overall
C-to-assembly compiler,
the correctness proofs are composed as well
to construct a correctness proof for the whole compiler.
The final theorem does not mention the intermediate
programs and language semantics,
so that a user only needs to trust
the accuracy of CompCert's C and assembly semantics,
and the soundness of the proof assistant.

Building on this precedent,
the CertiKOS verification effort~\cite{popl15,ccal,osdi16}
divided the kernel into several dozen abstraction layers
which were then specified and verified individually.
Layer specifications provide
an abstract view of the functionality of a given layer,
hiding the procedural details and low-level data representations
involved in its implementation.
Client code can then be verified in terms of
this abstract view
in order to build higher-level layers.
Certified layers
with compatible interfaces can then be chained together
in the same way that passes of a compiler
can be composed when the target language of one
corresponds to the source language of the other.

%}}}

\subsection{Semantic models for verification} %{{{

While this approach is compelling,
there are difficulties associated with extending it
to build larger-scale certified systems
by connecting disparate certified components.
A key aspect enabling composition in CompCert and CertiKOS
is the uniformity of the models underlying
their language semantics and correctness proofs.
By contrast,
across projects
there exist a great diversity
of semantics models and verification techniques.
This makes it difficult to formulate
interface specifications to connect specific components,
let alone devising a general system
to express such interfaces.

Worse yet,
this diversity is not simply a historical accident.
The semantic models
used in the context of individual verification projects
are often carefully chosen
to make the verification task tractable.
The semantic model used in CompCert alone
has changed multiple times,
addressing new requirements and techniques introduced alongside
new compiler features and optimization passes \cite{compsem}.
Given the difficulty of verification,
preserving this flexibility is essential.

Then,
to make it possible to link components
verified using a variety of paradigms,
we need to identify a model
expressive enough to embed
the language semantics, specifications and correctness proofs
of these paradigms.
In addition,
to enable the construction of large-scale certified systems,
the model should provide
high-level composition and reasoning principles.

%}}}

\subsection{General models for system behaviors} %{{{

Fortunately,
there is a wealth of semantics research to draw from
when attempting to design models for this task.

The framework of
symmetric monoidal categories,
which allows components to be
connected in series~($\circ$) and in parallel~($\otimes$),
captures general structures found
in various kinds of systems and processes \cite{rosetta},
and appears in different forms
in many approaches to logic and programming language semantics.

A particularly expressive instance of this phenomenon
is realized in \emph{game semantics} \cite{cspgs},
an approach to compositional semantics
which uses two-player games to model
the interaction between a component and its environment,
and represents the externally observable behavior
of the component as a strategy in this game.
The generality of games as
descriptions of the possible interactions of components
makes this general approach broadly applicable,
and the typed aspect of the resulting models
makes it ideal to the task of
describing the behavior of heterogeneous systems.

However,
the generality of game models
often translates to a fair amount of complexity,
which imposes a high barrier to entry for practitioners
and makes them difficult to formalize in a proof assistant.
While more restricted,
the framework of \emph{algebraic effect and handlers} \cite{eff}
is sufficient for many modeling tasks,
and fits within the well-known monadic approach
to modeling effectful and interactive computations,
and can be adapted into a particularly simple version
of game semantics.

\subsection{General formulations for correctness proofs}

While game models have been proposed
for a wide variety of programming languages,
there has comparatively been less focus
on the formulation of specifications and correctness properties
in the context of game semantics.
By contrast,
the general approach of \emph{stepwise refinement}
suggests a uniform treatment of programs, specifications
and their relationship.
It has been studied extensively in the context of
Diskstra's predicate transformer semantics,
in the framework know as the \emph{refinement calculus} \cite{refcal}.

In refinement-based approaches,
programs and specifications are expressed in a common language,
and a certified program is constructed in an incremental manner,
by applying a series of correctness-preserving transformation
to the (abstract and declarative) specification
until we obtain a (concrete and executable) program.
Correctness preservation is expressed
by a reflexive and transitive \emph{refinement relation} $\sqsubseteq$.
Language constructions are monotonic with respect to $\sqsubseteq$,
so that elementary refinement rules
can be applied congruently within any program context.

To make it possible to express specifications,
the language is extended with non-executable constructions,
including in particular infinitary versions of both
\emph{angelic} and \emph{demonic} nondeterministic choice operators.
In its modern presentation,
the refinement calculus is formulated in a lattice-theoretic framework
where joins ($\sqcup$) and meets ($\sqcap$)
correspond respectively to angelic and demonic choices.
The resulting language is remarkably expressive
and requires very few additional primitive constructions.
Specifications can express both safety and liveness properties.
The duality inherent in this approach
also lends itself to game-theoretic interpretations,
and indeed the semantics of the refinement calculus
can be expressed as a two-player game between
the angel and the demon.
%
%Like all approaches in the lineage of Hoare logic
%and predicate transformer semantics,
%the refinement calculus is limited to
%modelling imperative programs.
%[However,
%M\&T propose to extend it to terms and functionnal programming
%by constructing the FCD blah blah.]
%
%[Also: describe the idea of the \emph{refinement calculus hierarchy}
%(general and difficult <-> specific and easy to reason about
%and string properties).
%More than one level of ``semantics''
%Notions of ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' are relative concepts.]
%

\subsection{Contributions} %{{{

Our central claim is that a synthesis
of the existing research on
game semantics, algebraic effects, and the refinement calculus
can be used to construct a hierarchy of semantic models
suitable for the construction of large-scale, heterogeneous certified systems.

This paper seeks to provide evidence for this claim
by outlining the general techniques
which can be used to realize this synthesis
and demonstrating their use
in the context of certified abstraction layers:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  We build on the work of Morris and Tyrell \cite{augtyp,dndf},
  extending the refinement calculus to the level of terms
  by using \emph{free distributive completions} of posets,
  and investigate \emph{dual nondeterminism}
  in the context of game semantics.
  Using the free distributive completion
  instead of downsets when constructing strategies
  yields a completely distributive lattice of
  \emph{strategy specifications}
  under a form of alternating refinement
  \cite{altref}.
\item
  In \S\ref{sec:intspec},
  we define a version of the
  \emph{free monad on an effect signature}
  which incorporates dual nondeterminism and refinement.
  The result can be used to formulate a theory of certified abstraction
  layers in which
  layer interfaces, layer implementations and abstraction relations
  can be treated uniformly and compositionally.
\item
  In \S\ref{sec:gamesem},
  we carry out a similar scheme
  in the context of a simple category of games and
  strategy specifications,
  whose objects are elementary games derived from effect signatures
  and whose morphisms specify well-bracketed strategies.
  The behavior of certified abstraction layers
  can then be represented canonically,
  and reentrant layer interfaces can be modelled.
\end{itemize}
We conclude in \S\ref{sec:rw}
with a brief outline of related and future work.

\section{Background} \label{sec:background} %{{{

% Preamble {{{

The work presented in this paper
draws from a broad range of existing research.
This section summarizes the relevant aspects
of various lines of work,
and outlines how we combine them
to develop
refinement-based game semantics.

%}}}

\subsection{Dual nondeterminism and refinement} \label{sec:refcal} %{{{

% Preamble {{{

Correctness properties for imperative programs
are often stated as triples of the form $\htr{P}{C}{Q}$
asserting that
when the program $C$ is started in a state which
satisfies the predicate $P$ (the \emph{precondition}),
then the state in which $C$ terminates
will satisfy the predicate $Q$ (the \emph{postcondition}).
In the \emph{axiomatic} approach to programming language semantics,
inference rules
corresponding to the different constructions of the language
determine which triples are valid,
and the meaning of a program is identified with
the set of specifications $\htr{P}{-}{Q}$
which the program satisfies.

Axiomatic semantics
can accommodate nondeterminism in two different ways.
In the program $C_1 \sqcap C_2$,
a \emph{demon} will choose which of $C_1$ or $C_2$ is executed.
The demon will work against us,
so that if we want $C_1 \sqcap C_2$ to satisfy a given property,
we need to make sure we can deal with either choice.
This corresponds to the inference rule:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\htr{P}{C_1}{Q}}
    \hypo{\htr{P}{C_2}{Q}}
    \infer2{\htr{P}{C_1 \sqcap C_2}{Q}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
Conversely,
in the program $C_1 \sqcup C_2$,
an \emph{angel} will decide whether $C_1$ or $C_2$ is executed.
If possible,
the angel will make choices which validate
the correctness property.
This corresponds to the rules:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\htr{P}{C_1}{Q}}
    \infer1{\htr{P}{C_1 \sqcup C_2}{Q}}
  \end{prooftree}
  \qquad
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\htr{P}{C_2}{Q}}
    \infer1{\htr{P}{C_1 \sqcup C_2}{Q}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
In other words,
a triple $\htr{P}{C}{Q}$
can be thought of as a \emph{game}
between the angel and the demon.
The angel resolves the $\sqcup$ choices,
whereas the demon resolves $\sqcap$.
The triple is valid if there is a winning strategy
for the angel.

%}}}

\paragraph{Distributivity} %{{{

Note that in this setup,
$\sqcap$ and $\sqcup$ distribute over each other.
More precisely, for all $P, C_1, C_2, C_3, Q$:
\begin{align*}
  \htr{P}{C_1 \sqcap (C_2 \sqcup C_3)}{Q} &\Leftrightarrow
    \htr{P}{(C_1 \sqcap C_2) \sqcup (C_1 \sqcap C_3)}{Q} \\
  \htr{P}{C_1 \sqcup (C_2 \sqcap C_3)}{Q} &\Leftrightarrow
    \htr{P}{(C_1 \sqcup C_2) \sqcap (C_1 \sqcup C_3)}{Q}
\end{align*}
Consider the first equivalence above.
If the angel has a winning strategy for
the left-hand side triple,
they can win both $\htr{P}{C_1}{Q}$
and either $\htr{P}{C_2}{Q}$ or $\htr{P}{C_3}{Q}$.
Although the right-hand side triple
reverses the angel and demon's choices,
the angel can preemptively choose the left or right
disjunct depending on whether they can win
$\htr{P}{C_2}{Q}$ or $\htr{P}{C_3}{Q}$.
Likewise, if the angel can win the right-hand side,
then they have a winning strategy for the left-hand side as well.
The second equivalence corresponds to a similar situation
where the angel and demon have been exchanged.

%}}}

\paragraph{Program refinement} %{{{

Instead of proving program correctness in one go,
\emph{stepwise refinement} techniques use a more incremental approach
centered on the notion of program refinement.
A refinement $C_1 \sqsubseteq C_2$
means that any specification satisfied by $C_1$
will also be satisfied by $C_2$:
\[
    C_1 \sqsubseteq C_2 \: := \:
    \forall P Q \cdot
      \htr{P}{C_1}{Q} \Rightarrow
      \htr{P}{C_2}{Q}
\]
We say that $C_2$ refines $C_1$
or that $C_1$ is refined by $C_2$.

Typically,
under such approaches,
the language will be extended with constructions
allowing the user to describe
abstract specifications as well as
concrete programs.
The goal will then be to establish
a sequence of refinements
$C_1 \sqsubseteq \cdots \sqsubseteq C_n$
to show that a program $C_n$ involving
only executable constructions
correctly implements a specification $C_1$,
which may be stated in much more abstract terms.

Angelic and demonic choices
are particularly interesting in this light,
because they respectively give the
least upper bound and greatest lower bound
with respect to $\sqsubseteq$.
As a specification, $C_1 \sqcup C_2$
requires an implementation to refine
\emph{both} $C_1$ and $C_2$:
\[
    C_1 \sqcup C_2 \sqsubseteq C \: \Leftrightarrow \:
    C_1 \sqsubseteq C \: \wedge \: C_2 \sqsubseteq C \,,
\]
and $C_1 \sqcap C_2$
allows an implementation to refine
either:
\[
    C_1 \sqcap C_2 \sqsubseteq C \: \Leftarrow \:
    C_1 \sqsubseteq C \: \vee \: C_2 \sqsubseteq C \,.
\]

Note that in the context of \emph{specifications}
(on the left of $\sqsubseteq$),
the terminology of \emph{angelic} and \emph{demonic}
choices are somewhat counterintuitive
because they work in the opposite way:
demonic choices in the specification gives us more
implementation freedom,
and help us establish refinement,
whereas angelic choices make the specification
stronger and more difficult to implement.
Intuitively,
the \emph{user} of a specification
will need to be ready to handle any demonic choice
made in that specification.
The specification's implementer
will have more freedom because they \emph{are} the demon.
Conversely,
angelic choice requires the implementation
to behave appropriately
no matter which alternative the user decides to rely on.
Therefore,
we will often think of demonic choices as
choices of the \emph{system} we are considering,
and think of angelic choices as
choices of its \emph{environment}.

%}}}

\begin{color}{gray}
\paragraph{Unbounded choice} %{{{

Angelic and demonic choice
generalize to infinitary constructions,
which subsume many familiar ones.
For instance:
\begin{align*}
  \kw{abort} &:= \bigsqcup \varnothing &
  \{ P \} &:= \bigsqcup \{ \kw{skip} \mid P \} \\
  \kw{magic} &:= \bigsqcap \varnothing &
  [ P ] &:= \bigsqcap \{ \kw{skip} \mid P \}
\end{align*}
The program $\kw{abort}$ represents unconditional failure;
it is the least element with respect to $\sqsubseteq$
and can also be seen to denote completely unspecified behavior.
Conversely, $\kw{magic}$ refines \emph{any} specification,
and can be seen as the unimplementable behavior.
The \emph{assertion} $\{P\}$ checks whether
the predicate $P$ holds in the current state,
and behaves as either $\kw{skip}$ or $\kw{abort}$
depending on the result.
Dually, the \emph{assumption} $[P]$ behaves as
$\kw{skip}$ or $\kw{magic}$ depending on whether $P$ holds.

We will treat divergence as a catastrophic failure
and conflate it with \kw{abort}.
Under this approach,
we can define iteration as follows:
\[
  \kw{while} \: P \: \kw{do} \: C \: \kw{od} \: := \:
    \bigsqcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    (\{\neg P\}; C)^n ; \{P\}
\]
where $C^n$ is the $n$-fold sequential composition
$C ; C ; \cdots ; C$.

%In the presence of dual nondeterminism,
%generalized programs and specifications are sometimes
%known collectively as \emph{contracts}.
%The combination of angelic and demonic choices

%}}}
\end{color}

\paragraph{The refinement calculus} %{{{

These basic ingredients have been studied systematically
in the \emph{refinement calculus},
dating back to Ralph-Johan Back's 1978 PhD thesis \cite{backthesis}.
In its modern incarnation \cite{refcal},
the refinement calculus
subsumes programs and specifications with \emph{contracts}
featuring unbounded angelic and demonic choices.
These choice operators
constitute a completely distributive lattice
with respect to the refinement order.

Dijkstra's \emph{predicate transformer} semantics \cite{gc}
are a natural fit for the refinement calculus,
but other approaches are possible.
For instance,
the understanding of contracts as a game between
the angel and the demon
can be formalized to provide a form of
game semantics for the refinement calculus.

More generally,
the refinement calculus can be presented as a \emph{hierarchy}
where simpler models (state transformer functions, relations)
can be embedded in more general ones (predicate transformers)
in various structure-preserving ways.
This makes it possible to reason about simpler components
in a limited, stronger version of the framework,
while retaining the possibility of embedding them
in a setting
where more general constructions are available,
and where they can be composed with components
developed and analyzed in a different setting.
This expressivity is highly desirable
as a scalable approach to
verifying heterogeneous systems.

However,
like all methods in the lineage of Hoare logic
the refinement calculus can only by applied to imperative programs,
with no side-effects beyond changes to the global state.
Recent research has attempted to extend the paradigm
to a broader setting,
and the present work can be understood
as a step in this direction as well.

%}}}

\paragraph{Dually nondeterministic functions} %{{{

Morris and Tyrrell were able to extend
the lattice-theoretic approach used in the refinement calculus
to functional programming
\cite{augtyp,dndf,cspdnd}:
if types are interpreted as posets,
dual nondeterminism can be added at the type level
using their \emph{free distributive completion}.
This allows dual nondeterminism to be used
in a variety of new contexts.

A completely distributive lattice $L$ is a
free distributive completion of
a poset $C$ if there is
a monotonic function $\phi : C \rightarrow L$
such that
for any completely distributive lattice $M$
and monotonic function $f : C \rightarrow M$,
there exists a unique complete morphism $f^*_\phi : L \rightarrow M$
such that $f^*_\phi \circ \phi = f$:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    C \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[rd, "f"'] &
    L \arrow[d, "f^*_\phi", dashed] \\ & M
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
A free distributive completion of a poset
always exists and it is unique up to isomorphism.
We write $\mathbf{FCD}(C)$ for
the free distributive completion of $C$
(also known as the \emph{free completely distributive lattice} on $C$).

In \cite{augtyp}, Morris shows that
the free distributive completion of $(A, \le)$
can be constructed as one of:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{FCD}(A, {\le}) &:= \mathcal{D} \mathcal{U}(A, {\le}) &
  \mathbf{FCD}(A, {\le}) &:= \mathcal{U} \mathcal{D}(A, {\le}) \\
  \phi(a) &:= {\downarrow}{\uparrow} a &
  \phi(a) &:= {\uparrow}{\downarrow} a \,.
\end{align*}
In the expressions above,
$\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{U}$
are themselves completions.
A \emph{downset} of a poset $(A, {\le})$
is a subset $x \subseteq A$ satisfying:
\[
  \forall \, a, b \in x \bdot
          a \le b \wedge b \in x \Rightarrow a \in x \,.
\]
Unions and intersections preserve this property,
giving rise to the \emph{downset lattice} $\mathcal{D}(A, {\le})$,
which consists of all downsets of $(A, {\le})$,
ordered by set inclusion (${\subseteq}$) with
unions as joins and intersections as meets.
The dual \emph{upset lattice} $\mathcal{U}(A, {\le})$
is ordered by set containment (${\supseteq}$) with
intersections as joins and unions as meets.

Categorically speaking,
$\mathbf{FCD} : \mathbf{Poset} \rightarrow \mathbf{CDL}$
is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor
$U : \mathbf{CDL} \rightarrow \mathbf{Poset}$
from the category $\mathbf{CDL}$
of completely distributive lattices and complete homomorphisms
to the category $\mathbf{Poset}$
of partially ordered sets and monotonic functions.
As such, $U \! \circ \mathbf{FCD}$ is a monad over $\mathbf{Poset}$,
and can be used to model dual nondeterminism
as an effect.
In the remainder of this paper,
we identify $\mathbf{FCD}$ with
the monad $U \! \circ \mathbf{FCD}$,
and we refer to the function
$U(f_\phi^*)$ as the \emph{$\mathbf{FCD}$ extension} of $f$.

In order to specify effectful computations,
we will augment this monad with
arbitrary, uninterpreted effects.

%}}}

%}}}

\subsection{Effect signatures} \label{sec:bg:sig} %{{{

The framework of \emph{algebraic effects}
models computations as terms in an algebra
whose operations represent effects:
a term $m(x_1, \ldots x_n)$
represents a computation which first
triggers an effect $m$,
then continues as a computation derived from
the subcomputations $x_1, \ldots x_n$.
For example,
the term:
\[
    \kw{readbit}(
      \kw{print}["\text{Hello}"](\kw{done}),
      \kw{print}["\text{World}"](\kw{done}))
\]
could denote a computation which
first reads one bit of information,
then depending on the result
causes the words ``Hello'' or ``World'' to be output,
and finally terminates.

Under this approach,
effects can be described as generalized algebraic theories:
a signature describes the set of operations together with their arities,
and a set of equations describes their behaviors
by specifying which computations are equivalent.
The example above uses a signature with the operations
$\kw{done}$ of arity $0$,
$\kw{readbit}$ of arity $2$,
and a family of operations $(\kw{print}[s])_{s \in \kw{string}}$
of arity $1$.
An equation for this signature is:
\[
    \kw{print}[s](\kw{print}[t](x)) =
    \kw{print}[st](x) \,,
\]
which indicates that
printing the string $s$ followed by
printing the string $t$ is equivalent to
printing the string $st$ in one go.

In this work,
we use effect signatures to represent
the possible external interactions
of a computation,
but we will not use equational theories.
The \emph{interaction specification monad} $\mathcal{I}_E$
presented in \S\ref{sec:intspec}
combines the dual nondeterminism of $\mathbf{FCD}$ with
uninterpreted effects taken from
an arbitrary effect signature $E$.
We will however make it possible to interpret effects
into another completely distributive lattice,
modeling \emph{effect handlers}.

%}}}

\subsection{Game semantics} \label{sec:strat} %{{{

Game semantics is an approach to compositional semantics
which interprets types as two-player games
between a program component (the \emph{system})
and the context in which it appears (the \emph{environment}).
Terms of a given type are then interpreted as
strategies for the corresponding game,
specifying for each position in the game
the next action to be taken by the system.

An early success of this approach,
building on game models developed for
fragments of linear logic,
was the formulation of the first satisfactory
full abstraction results
for the functional programming language PCF \cite{pcfajm,pcfho}.
Since then,
game semantics has been extended to
model a wide variety of language features.

\paragraph{Traditional strategy models} %{{{

The \emph{plays} of a game are sequences of moves;
they both identify a position in the game
and describe the succession of actions that led to it.
Most game models of sequential computation
use \emph{alternating} games,
in which
the system and environment each contribute
every other move.
It is also common to require the environment to play first
and to focus on plays of even length,
which specify which action the system took
in response to the latest environment move.
We will write $P_G$ for the set of plays of the game $G$,
partially ordered by the prefix relation $\sqsubseteq$.

Traditionally \cite{gamesem99},
strategies are defined as
prefix-closed sets of plays,
so that strategies $\sigma \in \mathcal{S}_G$
for the game $G$ are downsets of $P_G$
satisfying certain requirements:
\[
    \mathcal{S}_G \subseteq
    \mathcal{D}(P_G, {\sqsubseteq})
\]
A common constraint is that $\sigma \in \mathcal{S}_G$
should not contain two plays $s m_1, s m_2 \in \sigma$
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are distinct moves of the system.
This is usually understood as
enforcing \emph{system determinism}:
given a set of environment choices,
there is only one possible behavior for the system.
Therefore,
relaxing this constraint has usually been understood
as the first step toward modeling nondeterministic systems
\cite{gsfnd}.
However,
looking at the situation through the lens of
the refinement calculus and dual nondeterminism,
we will come to a different conclusion,
giving this requirement the name
\emph{environment determinacy}.

As a poset completion,
the downset lattice
$\mathcal{D}(P_G, {\sqsubseteq})$
can be understood as
the \emph{free completely distributive join-semilattice}.
A play $s \in P_G$ can be lifted to a strategy
${\downarrow} s \in \mathcal{D}(P_G, {\sqsubseteq})$:
\[
    {\downarrow} s := \{ t \in P_G \mid t \sqsubseteq s \}
\]
Set inclusion corresponds to refinement of strategies,
and following the approach outlined in \S\ref{sec:refcal},
the lattice structure provides
arbitrary angelic and demonic choice operators.

Angelic nondeterminism
allows us to range over all possible choices of the environment
and record the resulting plays.
For instance,
a very simple strategy which computes
the double of a natural number $n$
provided by the environment
can be written as follows
(we underline moves of the system):
\[
  \sigma :=
    \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} {\downarrow}(n \cdot \underline{2n}) =
    \{ \epsilon, \: n, \: n \cdot \underline{2n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
\]
If we want $\sigma$ to be a looser specification,
so that an acceptable implementation
would be allowed to provide any answer in the interval
$[2n - 1, 2n + 1]$,
this strategy model becomes insufficient
because the downset lattice does not add enough meets,
forcing the specification to become
much coarser:
\[
  \sigma :=
    \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \:
    \bigcap_{-1 \le \delta \le 1}
    {\downarrow}(n \cdot \underline{2n+\delta}) =
    \{ \epsilon, n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \,,
\]
We will remedy this by using a richer completion.

%}}}

\paragraph{Dually nondeterministic strategies} %{{{

Our approach to nondeterminism in game semantics
will be to substitute $\mathbf{FCD}$ for $\mathcal{D}$
in the construction of strategies presented earlier. 
In this framework,
the more permissive strategy
can be written as:
\[
  \sigma :=
    \bigsqcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    \bigsqcap_{-1 \le \delta \le 1}
    \phi(n \cdot \underline{2n + \delta})
\]
Because of the properties of $\mathbf{FCD}$,
the strategy $\sigma$ will retain
not only angelic choices,
but demonic choices as well,
corresponding to the possible behaviors
of the system.
%In particular, we have that:
%\[
%    \sigma \nsqsubseteq \bigsqcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} n
%\]

\begin{color}{gray}

The precise construction we use for $\mathbf{FCD}$ is irrelevant,
and in general it will be much more intuitive
to think of it by its defining property as a free object and
write its elements in terms of $\phi$, $\sqcap$, $\sqcup$, and $-_\phi^*$
rather than use any concrete representation.
However, to work out this example
we will use the second construction of $\mathbf{FCD}$ above,
where $\mathcal{D}(A, {\le})$ appears,
making the connection with traditional strategy models
more easily apparent.
In this case, we obtain:
\[
    \sigma =
    \{ \chi \in \mathcal{D}(P_G, {\sqsubseteq}) \mid
       \exists \vec{\delta} \,
       \forall n \,.\,
       (n \cdot \underline{2n + \delta_n}) \in \chi \}
\]
In this representation,
each $\chi \in \sigma$
is a prefix-closed set of plays,
emulating the traditional strategies described in \S\ref{sec:strat}
and corresponding to a situation where all of the system's choices
have been fixed (here as $\vec{\delta} \in [-1,1]^\mathbb{N}$).

\end{color}

%}}}

\paragraph{Determinacy} %{{{

How should we understand
the traditional strategy containing $\{ sm_1, sm_2 \}$
when $m_1$ and $m_2$ are system moves?
Under our interpretation,
this does not correspond to
system nondeterminism;
\emph{by construction},
such nondeterminism cannot occur,
and indeed
${\downarrow} s m_1 \cap {\downarrow} s m_2 =
 {\downarrow} s \notni
 s m_1, s m_2$.
Instead,
we interpret this as an \emph{unobservable}
environment choice
between the outcomes $s m_1$ and $s m_2$.

[Can happen as consequence of abstraction.
Perhaps an assembly spec says
the outcome of a function should depend on the value of some
register which is considered irrelevant by the C calling convention.
If we try to lift this spec to the C level
we will get $s m_1 \sqcup s m_2$.
This can never be implemented by a C program
since C language semantics are determinate in the environment
(and deterministic for the system).]

[One question is whether
some form of determinate strategies
can still form a lattice
(with say, $sm_1 \sqcup sm_2 = s \top$).]

\end{figure*}
%}}}

To demonstrate the applicability of our results,
we will use them to construct
increasingly expressive theories of
\emph{certified abstraction layers}.
%We start with a semi-formal description,
%and will fill in the blanks as we go.
As described in \cite{popl15},
a certified abstraction layer
consists of a \emph{layer implementation} together with
two \emph{layer interfaces}:
the \emph{underlay} provides specifications for
the primitives available to the layer implementation;
the \emph{overlay} provides specifications for
the procedures which the layer implementation defines.
A layer $M$ implementing the overlay interface $L'$
on top of the underlay interface $L$ can be depicted as follows:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \infer0[L']{\fbox{\qquad M \qquad}}
    \infer1[L]{}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

A layer interface has three components:
a \emph{signature} which enumerates
primitive operations together with their types,
a set $S$ of the \emph{abstract states} of the layer interface,
and for each primitive
$\kw{op} : A \rightarrow B$
a \emph{specification}
given as a function:
\[
  \kw{op} : A \times S \rightarrow \mathcal{P}^1(B \times S) \,.
\]
Here $\mathcal{P}^1$ corresponds to the \emph{maybe} monad:
\[
  \mathcal{P}^1(A) := \{ x \subseteq A : |x| \le 1 \} \,,
\]
where the empty set $\varnothing \in \mathcal{P}^1(A)$
is used indiscriminately to capture
failure, silent divergence and otherwise unspecified behaviors.

As a running example,
we will use the certified layer
depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cal},
which implements a bounded queue with at most $N$ elements
using a circular buffer.
The underlay interface $L_\kw{rb}$
contains an array $f \in V^N$
with $N$ values of type $V$ and two counters
which will take values in the interval $0 \le c_1, c_2 < n$.
The array can be accessed through the primitives
$\kw{get}$ and $\kw{set}$;
the primitive $\kw{inc}_1$ and $\kw{inc}_2$
increment the corresponding counter
and return the counter's old value.

The overlay $L_\kw{bq}$ features two primitives
$\kw{enq}$ and $\kw{deq}$
which respectively add a new element to the queue
and remove the oldest element added.
If we attempt to add an element
which would overflow the queue's capacity $N$,
or we attempt to remove an element from an empty queue,
the result is undefined.

The layer implementation $M_\kw{bq}$ 
stores the queue's elements into the array,
between the indices given by the counters' values.
This is expressed by the simulation relation $R$,
which explains how overlay states are realized by $M_\kw{bq}$ 
in terms of underlay state.
The program $M_\kw{bq}$ can be interpreted in the monad:
\[
    S_\kw{rb} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}^1(- \times S_\kw{rb})
\]
used to define the operations of $L_\kw{rb}$.
Correctness is proved by showing
for each operation
$\kw{op} \in \{ \kw{enq}(v), \kw{deq}(*) \mid v \in V \}$
the simulation diagram:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:sim}
  L_\kw{bq}.\kw{op}
  \: \mathrel{[R \rightarrow \mathcal{P}^\le({=} \times R)]} \:
  M_\kw{bq}.\kw{op} \,,
\end{equation}
where the relators $\rightarrow$, $\times$, $\mathcal{P}^\le$
are defined by:
\[
  \begin{array}{rclcl}
    f & [R \rightarrow R'] & g & \Leftrightarrow &
    \forall x y \bdot x \mathrel{R} y \Rightarrow
    f(x) \mathrel{R'} g(y) \\
  x & [R_1 \times R_2] & y & \Leftrightarrow &
    \pi_1(x) \mathrel{R_1} \pi_1(y) \wedge
    \pi_2(x) \mathrel{R_2} \pi_2(y) \\
  s & \mathcal{P}^\le(R) & t & \Leftrightarrow &
    \forall x \in s \bdot \exists y \in t \bdot x \mathrel{R} y \,.
  \end{array}
\]
We will write $L_\kw{rb} \vdash_R M : L_\kw{bq}$
to express that condition (\ref{eqn:sim}) holds.
Certified abstraction layers presented in this way
can be vertically composed:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{L_2 \vdash_S M : L_3}
    \hypo{L_1 \vdash_R N : L_2}
    \infer2{L_1 \vdash_{S \circ R} M[N] : L_3}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

\section{The interaction specification monad} \label{sec:intspec} %{{{

We begin our formal development
by defining the \emph{interaction specification monad},
a variant of the free monad on an effect signature which
incorporates dual nondeterminism.

\subsection{Overview} %{{{

Given an effect signature $E$,
we construct a prefix-ordered set of plays $\bar{P}_E(A)$
corresponding to the possible interactions between
a computation with effects in $E$
and its environment,
including the computation's ultimate outcome in $A$.
The interaction specification monad $\mathcal{I}_E(A)$ is then obtained
as the free distributive completion of the poset $\bar{P}_E(A)$.

For each effect $e \in E$,
the interaction specification monad
has an operation
$\mathbf{I}_E^e \in \mathcal{I}_E(\kw{ar}(e))$
which triggers an instance of $e$ and returns its outcome.
Given a second signature $F$,
a family $(f^m)_{m \in F}$ of computations
$f^m \in \mathcal{I}_E(\kw{ar}(m))$
can be used to interpret the effects of $F$
into the signature $E$.
This is achieved by the \emph{substitution} operator,
which transforms a computation $x \in \mathcal{I}_F(A)$
into the computation $x[f] \in \mathcal{I}_E(A)$,
where each occurrence of an effect $m \in F$ in $x$
is replaced by the corresponding computation $f^m$.

Effect signatures can be seen to define
particularly simple games,
and a family $(f^m)_{m \in F}$ as described above
can be interpreted as
a certain kind of strategy for the game ${!E} \multimap F$.
We use this approach to define
a first category of games and strategy specifications,
where $\mathbf{I}_E$ is used as
the identity morphism for $E$ and
the substitution operator is used to define composition.

%}}}

\subsection{Effect signatures} %{{{

\begin{definition}
An \emph{effect signature}
is a set $E$ of operations
together with a mapping $\kw{ar}$,
which assigns to each $e \in E$ a set $\kw{ar}(e)$
called the \emph{arity} of $e$.
We will use the notation
$E = \{ e_1 : \kw{ar}(e_1), \: e_2 : \kw{ar}(e_2), \: \ldots \}$
to describe effect signatures.
\end{definition}

The most direct way to interpret an effect signature
is the algebraic point of view,
in which it induces a set of terms
built out of the signature's operations,
such as the example from \S\ref{sec:bg:sig}:
\[
    \kw{readbit}(
      \kw{print}["\text{Hello}"](\kw{done}),
      \kw{print}["\text{World}"](\kw{done}))
\]
The signature for the effects used in this term
can be written:
\[
  E_\kw{io} :=
  \{ \kw{readbit} : \mathbbm{2}, \:
     \kw{print}[s] : \mathbbm{1}, \:
     \kw{done} : \varnothing \mid
     s \in \kw{string} \}
\]

An effect signature can also be used
for decribing the interface of a monad $T$,
where each effect $e \in E$ corresponds to
a computation of type $T(\kw{ar}(e))$.
Presented as a monadic expression of type $T(\varnothing)$,
the example above corresponds to:
\[
  b \leftarrow \kw{readbit} \: ; \:
  \kw{print}[s_b] \: ; \:
  \kw{done}
\]
where $s_0 = "\text{Hello}"$ and $s_1 = "\text{World}"$.
Monads which offer this structure
include the free monad on the signature $E$,
which leaves effects entirely uninterpreted;
roughly, its computations of type $A$
correspond to terms over the signature
$E \uplus \{ v : \varnothing \mid v \in A \}$.
The interaction specification monad $\mathcal{I}_E$
described in this section is another example
of a monad with this interface.
It extends the free monad
to incorporate
a completely distributive lattice structure.

Finally,
an effect signature can also be seen as
a particularly simple \emph{game},
where plays consist of a single question $m \in E$ from the opponent,
followed by a single answer $n \in \kw{ar}(m)$ from the proponent.
\begin{color}{gray}
In traditional terms \cite{gamesem99},
this corresponds to the arena specified by:
\[
    \star \vdash m \vdash n \qquad
      (m \in E, \: n \in \kw{ar}(m))
\]
\end{color}
Then the terms induced by the signature
roughly correspond to a certain kind of \emph{strategies}
for the game $!(E^\bot)$,
in which the environment initiates successive
instances of $E$ which it plays as the proponent,
with the system as the opponent.
Indeed, the abstract syntax tree of our example term
can directly be read as the strategy:
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node (W) at (0,0) {};
    \node (R) at (0,-1) {$\kw{readbit}$};
    \node (W0) at (-2,-2) {$\kw{print}["\text{Hello}"]$};
    \node (W1) at (+2,-2) {$\kw{print}["\text{World}"]$};
    \node (K0) at (-2,-3) {$\kw{done}$};
    \node (K1) at (+2,-3) {$\kw{done}$};
    \path (W) edge node[auto,swap] {$*$} (R);
    \path (R) edge node[auto,swap] {0} (W0);
    \path (R) edge node[auto] {1} (W1);
    \path (W0) edge node[auto,swap] {$*$} (K0);
    \path (W1) edge node[auto,swap] {$*$} (K1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
where we interpret edge labels
as moves of the environment,
and node labels as moves of the system.

%Terms are constructed by
%applying function symbols $e \in E$
%to subcomputations given for each $r \in \kw{ar}(e)$.
%In simple cases,
%the computation $e(x_r)_{r \in \kw{ar}(e)}$
%first triggers an effect $e$;
%then the context chooses $r$
%and resumes the computation as $x_r$.
%For example,
%the following effect signature
%models a very basic input/output facility:
%\[
%  E_\kw{io} :=
%    \{ \kw{readbit} : \mathbbm{2}, \:
%       \kw{writebit}[n] : \mathbbm{1} \mid
%       n \in \mathbbm{2} \}
%\]
%A computation which writes a zero,
%reads one bit, echoes its complement
%and continues as the computation $k$
%can be written as:
%\[
%  \kw{writebit}[0](
%    \kw{readbit}(
%      \kw{writebit}[1](k),
%      \kw{writebit}[0](k)))
%\]

%}}}

\subsection{Plays} \label{sec:intm:plays} %{{{

Building on these ideas,
we now introduce the partially ordered sets of plays
which we use to construct our specification monad.

\begin{definition}
The set $\bar{P}_E(A)$ of \emph{interactions}
for an effect signature $E$ and set of values $A$
is defined inductively:
\[
  s \in \bar{P}_E(A) ::=
    \underline{v} \mid
    \underline{m} \mid
    \underline{m} n s \,,
\]
where $v \in A$, $m \in E$ and $n \in \kw{ar}(m)$.
The set $\bar{P}_E(A)$ is ordered by the prefix relation
${\sqsubseteq} \subseteq \bar{P}_E(A) \times \bar{P}_E(A)$,
defined
as the smallest relation satisfying:
\[
  \underline{v} \sqsubseteq \underline{v} \,, \qquad
  \underline{m} \sqsubseteq \underline{m} \,, \qquad
  \underline{m} \sqsubseteq \underline{m} n t \,, \qquad
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{s \sqsubseteq t}
    \infer1{\underline{m} n s \sqsubseteq \underline{m} n t}
  \end{prooftree} \,.
\]
\end{definition}

A play corresponds to a finite observation of
an interaction between the system and the environment.
At any point in such an interaction,
the system can terminate the interaction with a given value ($v$),
or it can trigger an effect $m \in E$ and
wait to be resumed by
an answer $n \in \kw{ar}(e)$ of the environment
($\underline{m} n s$).

A play which concludes before
the environment answers a query from the system ($\underline{m}$)
denotes that no information has been observed after that point.
It can be refined by a longer observation
of an interaction which begin with the same sequence of
questions and answers.
\ignore{\color{gray} Comment on the granularity?}

%}}}

\subsection{Interaction specifications} %{{{

We define our monad as the free distributive completion
of the corresponding poset of plays.

For the sake of conciseness and clarity,
we will use the order embedding associated with $\mathbf{FCD}$
implicitly,
so that an element of a poset $s \in P$
can also be regarded as an element of
its completion $s \in \mathbf{FCD}(P)$.
Likewise,
for a completely distributive lattice $L$,
we can implicitly
promote a monotonic operator
$f : P \rightarrow L$
to its extension
$f : \mathbf{FCD}(P) \rightarrow L$
as given by the universal property of
the free completely distributive lattice.
These conventions are at work
in the following definition.

\begin{definition} \label{def:intm} % Interaction specification monad {{{
The \emph{interaction specification monad}
for an effect signature $E$
maps a set of values $A$
to the free distributive completion
of the corresponding set of plays:
\[
    \mathcal{I}_E(A) :=
      \mathbf{FCD}(\bar{P}_E(A))
\]
An element $x \in \mathcal{I}_E(A)$ is called
an \emph{interaction specification}.

The monad's action on a function $f : A \rightarrow B$
replaces the values in
an interaction specification with their image by $f$:
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{I}_E(f)(\underline{v}) &:= \underline{f(v)} \\
  \mathcal{I}_E(f)(\underline{m}) &:= \underline{m} \\
  \mathcal{I}_E(f)(\underline{m} n s) &:=
    \underline{m} n \, \mathcal{I}_E(f)(s) \,.
\end{align*}
The monad's unit
$\eta^E_A : A \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_E(A)$
is the embedding of a single play
consisting only of the given value:
\[
    \eta^E_A(v) := \underline{v}
\]
Finally, the multiplication
$\mu^E_A : \mathcal{I}_E(\mathcal{I}_E(A)) \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_E(A)$
carries out the outer computation and
sequences it with any computation it evaluates to:
\begin{align*}
  \mu^E_A(\underline{x}) &:= x \\
  \mu^E_A(\underline{m}) &:= \underline{m} \\
  \mu^E_A(\underline{m} n s) &:=
    \underline{m} \sqcup \underline{m} n \, \mu^E_A(s) \,.
\end{align*}

\begin{proof} %{{{
From the definitions above and
the fact that $\mathbf{FCD}$ is itself a monad,
it is straightforward to verify that
for all functions $f : A \rightarrow B$,
\[
    \eta^E_B \circ f = \mathcal{I}_E(f) \circ \eta^E_A \,.
\]
By inductions on plays, we can also show that:
\[
    \mu^E_B \circ \mathcal{I}_E(\mathcal{I}_E(f)) =
      \mathcal{I}_E(f) \circ \mu^E_A \,.
\]
This establishes that $\eta^E$ and $\mu^E$
are natural transformations.
By a similar approach,
we can show for a set $X$ that:
\begin{align*}
  \mu^E_X \circ \mathcal{I}_E(\mu^E_X) &=
    \mu^E_X \circ \mu^E_{\mathcal{I}_E(X)} \\
  \mu^E_X \circ \mathcal{I}_E(\eta^E_X) &=
    \mu^E_X \circ \eta^E_{\mathcal{I}_E(X)} \,,
\end{align*}
so that $\mathcal{I}_E$ is indeed a monad.
\end{proof}
%}}}
\end{definition}
%}}}

The most subtle aspect of Def.~\ref{def:intm}
is the case for $\mu^E_A(\underline{m} n s)$,
which includes $\underline{m}$ as well as $\underline{m} n \mu^E_A(s)$.
This is both
to ensure that the effects of the first computation are preserved
when the second computation is undefined, and
to ensure the monotonicity of the underlying function
used to define $\mu^E_A$.
Consider for example
$\underline{m} n \underline{\bot} \in \bar{P}_E(\mathcal{I}_E(A))$.
The $\mathbf{FCD}$ extension
of the function $s \mapsto \underline{m} n s$
preserves $\bot$,
with the consequence that
$\underline{m} = \mu^E_A(\underline{m}) \nsqsubseteq
 \underline{m} n \mu^E_A(\underline{\bot}) = \bot$,
even though
$\underline{m} \sqsubseteq \underline{m} n \underline{\bot}$.

As usual,
the Kleisli extension of a function $f : A \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_E(B)$
is the function $f^\dagger = \mu^E_B \circ \mathcal{I}_E(f)$.
Given directly:
\begin{align*}
  f^\dagger(\underline{v}) &:= f(v) \\
  f^\dagger(\underline{m}) &:= \underline{m} \\
  f^\dagger(\underline{m} n s) &:=
    \underline{m} \sqcup \underline{m} n f^\dagger(s)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Basic constructions} %{{{

[Introduce the monadic notations and constructions
from the refinement calculus which we use in the rest
of the section]

\begin{color}{gray}

The refinement lattice over $\mathcal{I}_E(A)$
provides unbounded demonic choices
in the form of arbitrary meets
(realized as the union of the outer sets),
and unbounded angelic choices
in the form of arbitrary joins
(realized as the intersection of the outer sets).
A refinement $x \sqsubseteq y$ expresses that
$y$ offers fewer demonic choices and more angelic choices than $x$.

In particular,
the least element $\bot = \bigsqcup \varnothing$
corresponds to a situation where the environment has no choices
and the computation cannot be resumed.
It can be refined by any other computation and
we will use it to interpret undefined behaviors and silent divergence.
Conversely,
the greatest element $\top = \bigsqcap \varnothing$
corresponds to the \emph{magic} behavior
which refines all others:
the system has no choices,
therefore any behavior is vacuously satisfactory.

Another special case of angelic choice is
the \emph{assertion} of a proposition $P$,
which returns the trivial value $*$ if $P$ holds
and is equal to $\bot$ otherwise:
\[ \{P\} \in \mathcal{I}_E(\{*\}) :=
    \bigsqcup \{ \eta(*) \mid P \} \]
Dually,
the \emph{assumption} of $P$
is defined as follows,
and is equal to $\top$ when $P$ does not hold:
\[ [P] \in \mathcal{I}_E(\{*\}) :=
    \bigsqcap \{ \eta(*) \mid P \} \]

\end{color}

%}}}

\subsection{Interactions} %{{{

The operations of an effect signature $E$
can be promoted to interaction specifications of $\mathcal{I}_E$
as follows.

\begin{definition}[Interaction primitive]
For an effect signature $E$, a set $A$ and
an operation $m \in E$,
the interaction specification
$\mathbf{I}_E^m \in \mathcal{I}_E(\kw{ar}(m))$
is defined as:
\[
  \mathbf{I}_E^m :=
    \bigsqcup_{n \in \kw{ar}(m)} \underline{m} n \underline{n}
\]
If the context permits,
we can write $\mathbf{I}_E^m$ simply as $m$.
\end{definition}
Note that in the play $\underline{m} n \underline{n}$,
the first occurrence of $n$ is the environment's answer,
whereas the second occurrence is the value returned by $\mathbf{I}_E^m$.

To model effect handling,
we can use a family of interaction specifications
$(f^m)_{m \in F}$
to provide an interpretation $f^m \in \mathcal{I}_F(\kw{ar}(m))$
of each effect $m \in F$
in terms of another effect signature $E$.
This allows us to transform an interaction specification
$x \in \mathcal{I}_F(A)$ of $F$
into an interaction specification
$x[f]$ of $E$.

\begin{definition}[Interaction substitution]
Given the effect signatures $E, F$ and the set $A$,
for an interaction specification $x \in \mathcal{I}_F(A)$
and a family $(f^m)_{m \in E}$ with $f^m \in \mathcal{I}_E(\kw{ar}(m))$,
the \emph{interaction substitution} $x[f] \in \mathcal{I}_E(A)$
is defined by:
\begin{align*}
  \underline{v}[f] &:= \underline{v} \\
  \underline{m}[f] &:= f^m ; \bot \\
  \underline{m}ns[f] &:= r \leftarrow f^m ; \{r = n\} ; s[f] \,.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

The outcome of the interaction specification is left unchanged,
but effects are replaced by their interpretation.
Whenever the interpretation produces an outcome $r$,
the matching plays of the original computation
are allowed to proceed accordingly.

%}}}

\subsection{Game semantics} %{{{

As presented so far,
the interaction specification monad
can be seen as an extension of the refinement calculus
able to model effectful computations
for a given signature.

We now shift our point of view to game semantics
and show how interaction substitutions
can be used to define a simple category of games and strategies
featuring dual nondeterminism and refinement.

\begin{definition}[Interaction substitutions as morphisms]
Consider the effect signatures $E$, $F$ and $G$.
We will write $f : E \rightarrow F$
whenever $(f^m)_{m \in F}$ is a family of interactive computations
such that $f^m \in \mathcal{I}_E(\kw{ar}(m))$.
Then for $f : E \rightarrow F$ and $g : F \rightarrow G$,
we define $g \circ f : E \rightarrow G$ as:
\[ (g \circ f)^m = f^m[g] \,. \]
The completely distributive lattice structure
of $\mathcal{I}_F(-)$ can be extended pointwise
to interaction substitutions,
so that for a family $(f_i)_{i \in I}$
with $f_i : E \rightarrow F$,
we can define the substitutions
$(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} f_i) : E \rightarrow F$ and
$(\bigsqcap_{i \in I} f_i) : E \rightarrow F$ as:
\begin{gather*}
    \left( \bigsqcup_{i \in I} f_i \right)^m :=
      \bigsqcup_{i \in I} f_i^m \qquad
    \left( \bigsqcap_{i \in I} f_i \right)^m :=
      \bigsqcap_{i \in I} f_i^m \,,
\end{gather*}
and for $f, g : E \rightarrow F$
we can define refinement as:
\[
    f \sqsubseteq g \: \Leftrightarrow \:
    \forall m \in F \bdot f^m \sqsubseteq g^m \,.
\]
\end{definition}

An interaction substitution $f : E \rightarrow F$
can be interpreted as a \emph{well-bracketed} strategy for the game
${!E} \multimap F$.
In this game,
the environment first plays a move $m \in F$.
The system can then ask a series of questions
$q_1, \ldots q_k \in E$
to which the environment will reply with
answers $r_i \in \kw{ar}(q_i)$,
and finally produce an answer $n \in \kw{ar}(m)$
to the environment's initial question $m$.
\begin{color}{gray}
The arena for ${!E} \multimap F$
can be described as:
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    %\node (S) at (0,3) {$\star$};
    \node (BQ) at (0,2) {$m \in F$};
    \node (BA) at (-1,1) {$n \in \kw{ar}(m)$};
    \node (AQ) at (+1,1) {$q \in E$};
    \node (AA) at (+1,0) {$r \in \kw{ar}(q)$};
    %\path (S) edge (BQ);
    \path (BQ) edge (BA);
    \path (BQ) edge (AQ);
    \path (AQ) edge (AA);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
\end{color}
The plays of ${!E} \multimap F$
are restricted to a single top-level question $m$.
In addition, the well-bracketing requirement
imposes that at any point,
only the most recent pending question
may be answered.

Our model extends the usual notion of strategy
by introducing demonic choice and
relaxing the environment determinacy constraint.
The definition of $g \circ f$ given above
otherwise corresponds to the traditional
definition of strategy composition.
The identity strategy is given by $\mathbf{I}_E : E \rightarrow E$.

\begin{lemma}
Consider the effect signatures $E, F, G, H$ and
the substitutions
$f : E \rightarrow F$,
$g : F \rightarrow G$ and
$h : G \rightarrow H$.
The following properties hold:
\begin{gather*}
  \mathbf{I}_F \circ f = f \circ \mathbf{I}_E = f \\
  h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f
\end{gather*}
Composition preserves all suprema on the left,
and all non-empty suprema on the right.
\begin{proof}
As before,
using the monadic properties of $\mathbf{FCD}$
and inductions on plays.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Having established the relevant properties,
we can now define our first category of games and strategies.

\begin{definition}
The category $\gcat^{ib}$ has effect signatures as objects
and interaction substitutions as morphisms.
The hom-sets $\gcat^{ib}(E, F)$
are completely distributive lattices,
with composition preserving all suprema on the left,
and all non-empty suprema on the right.
\end{definition}

%}}}

\subsection{Products} %{{{

Effect signatures can be combined in the following way.

\begin{definition}
We define the effect signature
$\mathbf{1} := \varnothing$.
For a family of effect signatures $(E_i)_{i \in I}$,
we define:
\[
  \bigotimes_i E_i := \{ (i, e) : \kw{ar}(e) \mid i \in I, e \in E_i \}
\]
\end{definition}

For example,
the signature $E_\kw{io}$ above is equivalent
to the following composite one:
\[
    \{ \kw{readbit} : \mathbbm{2} \} \otimes
    \{ \kw{print}[s] : \mathbbm{1} \mid s \in \kw{string} \} \otimes
    \{ \kw{done} : \varnothing \}
\]

The construction $\otimes$ gives products in the category $\gcat^{ib}$,
as demonstrated below.

\begin{lemma}
The category $\gcat^{ib}$ has all products.
The corresponding objects are given by $\bigotimes_{i \in I} E_i$,
and the projection arrow
is given for each $i \in I$ as
the interaction substitution:
\begin{gather*}
    \pi_i : \bigotimes_{j \in I} E_j \rightarrow E_i \qquad
    \pi_i^m := (i, m) \,.
\end{gather*}
\begin{proof}
We need to show that for an effect signature $X$
and a collections of substitutions $(f_i)_{i \in I}$ with
$f_i : X \rightarrow E_i$,
there is a unique
$\langle f_i \rangle_{i \in I} : X \rightarrow \bigotimes_{i \in I} E_i$
such that for all $i \in I$:
\[
    f_i = \pi_i \circ \langle f_j \rangle_{j \in I} \,.
\]
Note that for $x : X \rightarrow \bigotimes_{i \in I} E_i$,
$i \in I$ and $m \in E_i$, we have:
\[
    (\pi_i \circ x)^m = \pi_i^m[x] = (i, m) [x] = x^{(i, m)}
\]
Hence, $\langle f_i \rangle_{i \in I}$ is uniquely defined as:
\[
    \langle f_i \rangle_{i \in I}^{(j, m)} := f_j^m \,.
\]
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

%}}}

\subsection{Certified abstraction layers} %{{{

Certified abstraction layers can be embedded into
the category $\gcat^{ib}$ as follows.

\paragraph{Signatures}

The signature of a layer interface or implementation
can be encoded as an effect signature.
For example:
\begin{align*}
  E_\kw{bq} &:= \{
    \kw{enq}[v] : \mathbbm{1}, \kw{deq} : V \mid
    v \in V \} \\
  E_\kw{rb} &:= \{
    \kw{set}[i, v] : \mathbbm{1},
    \kw{get}[i] : V,
    \kw{inc}_1 : \mathbb{N},
    \kw{inc}_2 : \mathbb{N} \mid
    i \in \mathbb{N}, v \in V \}
\end{align*}
A layer implementation $M$ with
an underlay signature $E$ and
an overlay signature $F$
can then be interpreted as a morphism
$\llbracket M \rrbracket : E \rightarrow F$
in a straightforward manner,
by interpreting underlay operations
used in the definition of $M$
by the corresponding interaction primitives:
\[
  \llbracket M \rrbracket^m := (M.m)[e := \mathbf{I}_E^e]_{e \in E}
\]

\paragraph{Interfaces}
In order to handle the layer's abstract data,
we can extend signatures with state in the following way:
\[
  E@S :=
    \{ m@k : \kw{ar}(m) \times S \mid
       m \in E, k \in S \}
\]
A layer interface $L$ with a signature $E$
and states in $S$
corresponds to a morphism $\llbracket L \rrbracket : 1 \rightarrow E@S$
almost directly:
\[
  \llbracket L \rrbracket^{m@s} :=
    \bigsqcup L.m@s
\]

\paragraph{Keeping state}
For a morphism $f : E \rightarrow F$,
we construct $f@S : E@S \rightarrow F@S$
which keeps updating a state $k \in S$
as it performs effects in $E@S$,
then adjoins the final state to any answer
returned by $f$.
We define
$-\#- : \bar{P}_E \times S \rightarrow \mathcal{S}_{E@S}$:
\begin{align*}
  \underline{v}\#k &:= \underline{v@k} \\
  \underline{m}\#k &:= \underline{m@k} \\
  \underline{m}ns\#k &:=
    \bigsqcup_{k' \in S} \, \underline{m@k} \,\, n@k' \, s\#k' \,,
\end{align*}
and extend it to morphisms as $(f@S)^{m@k} := f^m\#k$.
Then in particular,
running a layer implementation
$\llbracket M \rrbracket : E \rightarrow F$
on top of a layer interface
$\llbracket L \rrbracket : 1 \rightarrow E@S$
yields the morphism
$\llbracket M \rrbracket @ S \circ \llbracket L \rrbracket :
 1 \rightarrow F@S$.

\paragraph{Simulation relations}

The most interesting aspect of our embedding
is the representation of simulation relations.
We will see that dual nondeterminism
allows us to represent them as regular morphisms.

Recall the definition of
the correctness judgement $L_1 \vdash_R L_2$,
which means that a layer implementation $M$
correctly implement $L_2$ on top of $L_1$
through a simulation relation $R \subseteq S_1 \times S_2$.
If we write $L_1'$ for the layer interface obtained
by interpreting $M$ on top of $L_1$,
then:
\[
  L_1 \vdash_R M : L_2 \:\Leftrightarrow\:
  \forall m \in E_2 \bdot
    {L_1'}^m
    \mathrel{[R \rightarrow \mathcal{P}^\le({=} \times R)]}
    L_2^m
\]
We will use families of morphisms
$R_*^E : E@S_2 \rightarrow E@S_1$ and
$R^*_E : E@S_1 \rightarrow E@S_2$
to encode this judgement
as two equivalent refinement properties:
\begin{align*}
  (R^*_E)^{m@k_1} &:=
    \bigsqcup_{k_1 \mathrel{R} k_2}
    \bigsqcup_{k_2' \in S_2}
    \bigsqcap_{k_1' \mathrel{R} k_2'}
    \, \underline{m@k_2} \, n@k_2' \, \underline{n@k_1'} \\
  (R_*^E)^{m@k_2} &:=
    \bigsqcap_{k_1 \mathrel{R} k_2}
    \bigsqcup_{k_1' \in S_1}
    \bigsqcup_{k_1' \mathrel{R} k_2'}
    \, \underline{m@k_1} \, n@k_1' \, \underline{n@k_2'}
\end{align*}
In the first case,
$R^*_E$ represents a high-level behavior
which uses overlay states $k_1, k_2' \in S_2$
as a low-level 

translates between a low-level environment,
which uses underlay states $k_1, k_1' \in S_1$,
and an overlay specification,
If there is \emph{any} overlay state matching
the current underlay state,
the client expects to be able to rely on 

\begin{lemma}
Define
$\sigma := \llbracket M \rrbracket @ S_1 \circ \llbracket L_1 \rrbracket$.
Then:
\[
  L_1 \vdash_R M : L_2
  \: \Leftrightarrow \:
  R^*_{E_2} \!\circ \llbracket L_2 \rrbracket \sqsubseteq \sigma
  \: \Leftrightarrow \:
  \llbracket L_2 \rrbracket \sqsubseteq R_*^{E_2} \!\circ \sigma
\]
\end{lemma}

\section{Stateful and reentrant strategies} \label{sec:gamesem} %{{{

% Preamble {{{

As we have shown,
the morphisms of $\gcat^{ib}(E, F)$
correspond to well-bracketed strategies
for the game ${!E} \multimap F$.
By the \emph{bang lemma} given in \cite{gamesem99},
they also corresponds to the
\emph{innocent} well-bracketed strategies
for the game ${!E} \multimap {!F}$.

That game proceeds similarly to ${!E} \multimap F$,
but instead of playing a single instance of $F$,
the environment is free to instantiate a new instance
whenever it is in control,
by asking a new top-level question $m \in F$.
The system's own questions in ${!E}$
are made in the context of a specific question in ${!F}$;
this information is often encoded using \emph{justification pointer},
whereby all non-top-level moves are required to refer to
an earlier move,
in a way that is compatible with the enabling relation
used to define the game's arena.
The well-bracketing condition only allows the players
to answer the most recent pending question.
In our limited setting,
the innocence condition requires that the system
behave in the same way for each top-level question.

To specify an innocent strategy
for our game ${!E} \multimap {!F}$,
it is enough to specify its behavior
for a single question of $F$:
the behavior of the full strategy can be reconstructed
by duplicating this behavior whenever needed.
This is traditionally expressed as a promotion operator
mapping a strategy $\sigma : {!A} \multimap B$
to the strategy $\sigma^\dagger : {!A} \multimap {!B}$.

%}}}

\subsection{Overview} %{{{
\label{sec:arrow}

In the game ${!E} \multimap {!F}$,
when the system asks a question in ${!E}$,
the environment may delay its answer
and instead ask a new question of its own in ${!F}$.
Since we only consider well-bracketed strategies,
such ``reentrant'' questions must be answered by the system
before then environment can answer the original one.

More generally,
the well-bracketing requirement
enforces a kind of \emph{stack discipline}
on the succession of questions and answers.
A well-bracketed play
can be interpreted as an activation tree,
where questions are understood as function calls
between the system and the environment,
and answers to a question are understood as the
corresponding function call returning.
The stack discipline is enforced by the fact that
questions must be answered in the reverse order
in which they were asked.
The alternation constraint
corresponds to the sequential nature of the computation.

%}}}

\subsection{Games} %{{{

To facilitate reasoning,
and make it easier to describe operators on strategies
in a systematic way,
we describe games as a specific kind of graph
where vertices represent players
and edges represent questions that can be asked
by one player to another.
%Operations on plays and strategies
%can then be specified in terms of
%their action on individual questions.
Generalizing from effect signatures,
questions are assigned an arity
which gives the type of the answer.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{game signature} $\Gamma$
is a set of players with a distinguished element $\kw{O}$,
together with an effect signature $\Gamma(u, v)$
for all $u, v \in \Gamma$.
The operations $m \in \Gamma(u, v)$ are called
the \emph{questions} of $u$ to $v$,
and the elements $n \in \kw{ar}(m)$ are called
\emph{answers} to the question $m$.
\end{definition}

We will depict game signatures as directed graphs
whose vertices are the players and
whose edges are labelled by the corresponding signature.
Missing edges correspond to the empty signature $\varnothing$.
For example,
%an effect signature $E$ corresponds to
%the single-player game signature:
%\[
%  [E] =
%  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O.base)]
%    \node[circle,double,draw] (O) at (0,0) {$\kw{O}$};
%    \path[->] (O) edge[loop right] node[auto] {E} (O);
%  \end{tikzpicture} \,,
%\]
%and
the game ${!E} \multimap {!F}$ will be generated by
the game signature:
\[
  [E,F] =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O.base),scale=1.5]
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O) at (0,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P) at (-1,0) {$\kw{P}$};
    \path[->] (P) edge[bend left] node[above] {$E$} (O);
    \path[->] (O) edge[bend left] node[below] {$F$} (P);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
When we consider the ways in which questions propagate
through a system such as the one above,
the distinguished player $\kw{O}$ serves the role
of both a source and sink.
As such, it is visually useful
to depict $\kw{O}$ as two nodes,
one capturing the incoming edges of $\kw{O}$, and
one capturing its outgoing edges.
For example,
the following game signature
generates the interaction sequences
used in the definition of
strategy composition:
\[
  [E,F,G] =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O1.base),scale=1.2]
    \node[circle,double,draw] (O1) at (0,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P1) at (-1,0) {$\kw{P}_2$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P2) at (-2,0) {$\kw{P}_1$};
    \node[circle,double,draw] (O2) at (-3,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \path[->] (O1) edge node[above] {$G$} (P1);
    \path[->] (P1) edge node[above] {$F$} (P2);
    \path[->] (P2) edge node[above] {$E$} (O2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]

As another example of a game signature,
a situation where
$\sigma_1 : E_1 \rightarrow F_1$ and
$\sigma_2 : E_2 \rightarrow F_2$
interact with the environment
independently of one another
can be described as:
\[
  [E_1,F_1] \vee [E_2,F_2] =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O.base),xscale=1.2]
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O1) at (+1,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O2) at (-1,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P1) at (0,+0.5) {$\kw{P}_1$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P2) at (0,-0.5) {$\kw{P}_2$};
    \path[->] (O1) edge node[auto=right] {$F_1$} (P1);
    \path[->] (P1) edge node[auto=right] {$E_1$} (O2);
    \path[->] (O1) edge node[auto=left] {$F_2$} (P2);
    \path[->] (P2) edge node[auto=left] {$E_2$} (O2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
The signature above will be used to compute
tensor products of strategies.
These constructions generalize as follows.

\begin{definition}[Constructions on game signatures]
For a collection of effect signature $(E_i)_{1 \le i \le n}$
and an effect signature $F$,
the game signature $[ E_1, \ldots, E_n, F ]$
has the players
$\kw{O}, \kw{P}_1, \ldots, \kw{P}_n$
and the following edges:
\[
  [E_1, \ldots, E_n, F] :=
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2,baseline=(O.base)]
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O1) at (0,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \node[circle,draw] (P1) at (1,0) {$\kw{P}_1$};
    \node (D) at (2,0) {$\ldots$};
    \node[circle,draw] (Pn) at (3,0) {$\kw{P}_n$};
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O2) at (4,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \path[->] (P1) edge node[above] {$E_1$} (O1);
    \path[->] (D) edge node[above] {$E_2$} (P1);
    \path[->] (Pn) edge node[above] {$E_n$} (D);
    \path[->] (O2) edge node[above] {$F$} (Pn);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
For a collection of game signatures $(\Gamma_i)_{i \in I}$,
the \emph{wedge sum} $\bigvee_{i \in I} \Gamma_i$ has the players:
\[
    \{ \kw{O} \} \cup
    \{ (i, p) \mid i \in I \wedge p \in \Gamma_i \setminus \{ \kw{O} \} \}
\]
For $i \in I$ and $p \in \Gamma_i$, the corresponding player in
$\bigvee_{j \in I} \Gamma_j$ is:
\[
  \iota_i(p) := \begin{cases}
    \kw{O} & \text{if } p = \kw{O} \\
    (i, p) & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\]
Then for each question $m : u \rightarrow v$ in $\Gamma_i$,
the wedge sum has a corresponding question
$\iota_i(m) : \iota_i(u) \rightarrow \iota_i(v)$.
\end{definition}

%Note that the empty game signature $0$ can be
%described in the following way:
%\[
%  0 := \bigvee \varnothing =
%  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O.base)]
%    \node[circle,draw,double] {$\kw{O}$};
%  \end{tikzpicture}
%\]

%}}}

\subsection{Plays and strategies} %{{{

The description of the game ${!E} \multimap {!F}$
using the game signature $[E, F]$
already encodes the alternating aspect of plays.
The well-bracketed plays over a game signature
can be described as follows.

\begin{definition}[Well-bracketed plays]
The \emph{balanced plays}
starting at each player in
a game signature $\Gamma$
are given
as the family of sets
$(\hat{P}_\Gamma^u)_{u \in \Gamma}$
defined inductively by the rules:
\[
  \epsilon \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^u
  \qquad
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{s \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^u}
    \hypo{m \in \Gamma(u, v)}
    \hypo{t \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^v}
    \hypo{n \in \kw{ar}(m)}
    \infer4{smtn \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^u}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
The \emph{well-bracketed plays}
from one player to another
are given as the family of sets
$(P_\Gamma^{u,v})_{u,v \in \Gamma}$
defined by:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{s \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^u}
    \infer1{s \in P_\Gamma^{u,u}}
  \end{prooftree}
  \qquad
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{s \in \hat{P}_\Gamma^u}
    \hypo{m \in \Gamma(u, v)}
    \hypo{t \in P_\Gamma^{v,w}}
    \infer3{smt \in P_\Gamma^{u,w}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
\end{definition}

This direct definition of well-bracketed plays
is similar to the one given in \cite{mwjava}.
To define strategies,
we will consider in particular the plays
starting and ending at player $\kw{O}$.

\begin{definition}[Plays and strategies over a game signature]
The well-bracketed plays over a game signature $\Gamma$
are ordered under the prefix relation
defined by the rules:
\[
  \epsilon \sqsubseteq s \sqsubseteq smt \sqsubseteq smtn
  \qquad \qquad
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{t \sqsubseteq t'}
    \infer1{smt \sqsubseteq smt'}
  \end{prooftree} \,.
\]
We will write
$P \, \Gamma := \langle P_\Gamma^{\kw{O},\kw{O}}, {\sqsubseteq} \rangle$
for the poset of plays over $\Gamma$.
The \emph{strategy specifications} for $\Gamma$
are given by its completion:
\[
    S \, \Gamma := \mathbf{FCD}(P \, \Gamma) \,.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Operations on strategies} %{{{

\begin{definition}
A \emph{transformation}
from the game signature $\Gamma_1$
to the game signature $\Gamma_2$
associates to each player $p \in \Gamma_1$ a player $f(p) \in \Gamma_2$
with $f(\kw{O}) = \kw{O}$,
and to each question $m \in \Gamma_1(u,v)$
a \emph{path} of questions in $\Gamma_2$:
\[
  f(u) = p_0 \xrightarrow{m_1'} p_1 \xrightarrow{m_2'} \cdots
             \xrightarrow{m_n'} p_n = f(v) \,,
\]
written as
$f(m) = m_1' m_2' \cdots m_n' : f(u) \twoheadrightarrow f(v)$, and
such that
$\kw{ar}(m_1') = \cdots = \kw{ar}(m_n') = \kw{ar}(m)$.
We extend $f$ itself to the paths in $\Gamma_1$
by taking the image of $m_1 \cdots m_n : u \twoheadrightarrow v$
to be:
\[
  f(m_1 \cdots m_n) := f(m_1) \cdots f(m_n) :
    f(u) \twoheadrightarrow f(v) \,.
\]
In other words,
a transformation
is a structure-preserving map on paths.
We write $\mathbf{GST}$ for the category of
game signatures and transformations.
\end{definition}

These transformations can then be extended to plays.

\begin{definition}[Action on plays]
A transformation
$f : \Gamma_1 \rightarrow \Gamma_2$
can be extended to a monotonic function on plays
$P f  : P \, {\Gamma}_1 \rightarrow P \, {\Gamma}_2$.
We define:
\begin{align*}
  P f (\epsilon) &= \epsilon \\
  P f (smt) &= P f (s) \cdot f(m) \cdot P f (t) \\
  P f (smtn) &= P f (s) \cdot f(m) \cdot P f (t) \cdot n^{|f(m)|} \,,
\end{align*}
where $n^{|f(m)|}$ denotes a sequence $nn \cdots n$
of copies of the answer $n \in \kw{ar}(m)$
of same length as the path $f(m)$.
\end{definition}

Operators on strategies will generally be defined
by a game signature of global \emph{interaction sequences},
and using transformations to project out
the corresponding plays of the arguments and the result.

\paragraph{Composition} %{{{

When composing the strategy specifications
$\sigma \in S \, [E, F]$ and
$\tau \in S \, [F, G]$
to obtain $\tau \circ \sigma \in S \, [E, F]$,
we will use the transformation
$\psi^c_X : [E,F,G] \rightarrow [E,G]$
to describe the externally observable behavior
of the game $[E,F,G]$:
\begin{gather*}
  \psi^c_X(\kw{P}_1) = \psi^c_X(\kw{P}_2) = \kw{P} \qquad
  \psi^c_X(\kw{O}) = \kw{O}
  \\
  \psi^c_X(m) = \begin{cases}
    \epsilon & \text{if } m \in F \\
    m & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{gather*}
This can be described concisely as
$\psi^c_X = [1,0,1]$,
with:
\begin{align*}
  \psi^c_1 &:= [1,1,0] :
    [E,F,G] \rightarrow [E,F] \\
  \psi^c_2 &:= [0,1,1] :
     [E,F,G] \rightarrow [F,G]
\end{align*}
defined similarly.

We can now formulate the composition of strategy specifications as follows.
The ``footprint'' of the plays $s_1 \in P \, [E,F]$ and $s_2 \in P \, [F,G]$
can be defined as:
\[
  \psi^c(s_1, s_2) :=
    \bigsqcup_{s \in P [E,F,G]}
    \{ \psi^c_1(s) \sqsubseteq s_1 \wedge \psi^c_2(s) \sqsubseteq s_2 \} ;
    \psi^c_X(s) \,.
\]
In other words,
the angel chooses a global play $s$
matching $s_1$ and $s_2$
and produces its external view.
By extending $\psi^c$ to strategy specifications
in the expected way, we obtain:
\[
  \tau \circ \sigma = 
    s \leftarrow \sigma ;
    t \leftarrow \tau ;
    \psi^c(s, t) \,.
\]

%}}}

\paragraph{Identity} %{{{

The strategy $\mathrm{id}_E \in S \, [E,E]$
uses the signature:
\[
  [E] =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=(O.base)]
    \node[circle,draw,double] (O) at (0,0) {$\kw{O}$};
    \path[->] (O) edge[loop left] node[auto] {$E$} (O);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
and the transformation:
\begin{gather*}
  \psi^\mathrm{id}_X := [2] : [E] \rightarrow [E,E] \\
  \psi^\mathrm{id}_X(\kw{O}) := \kw{O} \qquad
  \psi^\mathrm{id}_X(m) := mm
\end{gather*}
Then $\mathrm{id}_E$ is defined as:
\[
  \mathrm{id}_E :=
    \bigsqcup_{s \in P [E]} \psi^\mathrm{id}_X(s) \,.
\]

%}}}

\paragraph{Tensor} %{{{

The tensor product of the strategies
$\sigma_1 \in S\,[E_1,F_1]$ and 
$\sigma_2 \in S\,[E_2,F_2]$
is a strategy
$\sigma_1 \otimes \sigma_2 \in S\,[E_1 \otimes E_2, F_1 \otimes F_2]$
defined using interaction sequences in
$\Gamma = [E_1,F_1] \vee [E_2,F_2]$.
The external projection
$\psi^\otimes_X : \Gamma \rightarrow [E_1 \otimes E_2, F_1 \otimes F_2]$
is:
\begin{gather*}
  \psi^\otimes_X(\kw{O}) = \kw{O} \qquad
  \psi^\otimes_X(\kw{P}_1) = \psi^\otimes_X(\kw{P}_2) = \kw{P} \\
  \psi^\otimes_X(\iota_i(m)) = \iota_i(m)
\end{gather*}
The internal projections
$\psi^\otimes_i : \Gamma \rightarrow [E_i, F_i]$
are given by:
\begin{align*}
  \psi^\otimes_i(p) &= \begin{cases}
    \kw{P} & \text{if } p = \kw{P}_i \\
    \kw{O} & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
  \psi^\otimes_i(\iota_j(m)) &= \begin{cases}
    m & \text{if } i = j \\
    \epsilon & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
The footprint of the plays
$s_1 \in P [E_1,F_1]$ and $s_2 \in P [E_2, F_2]$
is:
\[
  \psi^\otimes(s_1, s_2) :=
  \bigsqcup_{s \in P \Gamma}
  \{ \psi^\otimes_1(s) \sqsubseteq s_1 \wedge
     \psi^\otimes_2(s) \sqsubseteq s_2 \} ;
  \psi^\otimes_X(s)
\]
The tensor product can then be defined as:
\[
  \sigma_1 \otimes \sigma_2 :=
  s_1 \leftarrow \sigma_1 ;
  s_2 \leftarrow \sigma_2 ;
  \psi^\otimes(s_1, s_2)
\]

%}}}

\paragraph{Category}

The category $\gcat^b$
has effect signatures as objects,
and elements of $S [E,F]$
as morphisms $\sigma : E \rightarrow F$.
The categorical structure is as above.
