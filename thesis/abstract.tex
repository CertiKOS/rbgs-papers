Formal methods have advanced to the point where
the functional correctness of various large
system components has been mechanically verified.
However,
the diversity of semantic models used across projects
makes it difficult to connect these component
to build larger certified systems.
%Therefore,
Given this,
we seek to embed these models and proofs
into a general-purpose framework
where they could interact. %be made interoperable.
%linked together to
%construct certified heterogeneous systems.
We believe that a synthesis of game
semantics, the refinement calculus, and algebraic effects can
provide such a framework.

To combine game semantics and refinement, we replace the downset
completion typically used to construct strategies from posets of plays.
Using the \emph{free completely distributive completion},
we construct \emph{strategy specifications}
equipped with arbitrary angelic and demonic choices
and ordered by a generalization of alternating refinement.
This provides a novel approach to nondeterminism in game semantics.

%To connect
Connecting algebraic effects and game semantics, we interpret effect
signatures as games and define two
categories %$\gcat^{ib}$ and $\gcat^b$
of effect signatures and strategy
specifications.
The resulting models are sufficient to represent the behaviors
of a variety of low-level components,
including the \emph{certified abstraction layers}
used to verify the operating system
kernel CertiKOS. %~\cite{popl15}.
